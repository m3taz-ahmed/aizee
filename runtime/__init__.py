"""aiZee runtime kernel.

This package re-exports ~250 symbols for convenient access. The exports are
resolved lazily via PEP 562 (``__getattr__``): ``from runtime import X`` and
``runtime.X`` attribute access import the backing submodule on first use and
cache it in ``globals()``. ``import runtime`` alone therefore stays cheap;
previously it eagerly imported every governance module (~0.5 s + 120
submodules) for every CLI invocation and test worker.

Type checkers still see the full import set under ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` so
``from runtime import Kernel`` resolves to the real type. ``dir(runtime)``
advertises the full export table; ``hasattr``/``getattr`` semantics are
unchanged. Submodules are also reachable as attributes (``runtime.budget``)
via the same lazy path. ``importlib.reload(runtime)`` resets the cache.

Not all exports are wired into the production kernel pipeline - see the
doctor wiring table (``aizee doctor``) for call-site truth.
