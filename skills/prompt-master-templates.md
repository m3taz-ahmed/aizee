Response: [Format, length, and structure of the output]
```

## Template C — RISEN
[REQ] Complex projects, multi-step tasks.
```
Role: [Expert identity the AI should adopt]
Instructions: [Overall task in plain terms]
Steps:
  1. [First action]
  2. [Second action]
  3. [Continue as needed]
End Goal: [What the final output must achieve]
Narrowing: [Constraints, scope limits, what to exclude]
```

## Template D — CRISPE
[REQ] Creative work, brand voice writing.
```
Capacity: [What capability or expertise the AI should have]
Role: [Specific persona to adopt]
Insight: [Key background insight that shapes the response]
Statement: [The core task or question]
Personality: [Tone and style — witty / authoritative / casual / sharp]
Experiment: [Request variants or alternatives to explore]
```

## Template E — Chain of Thought
[REQ] Logic, math, debugging.
[PROHIBIT] NEVER use for o1/o3/Claude extended reasoning models.
```
[Task statement]

Before answering, think through this carefully:
<thinking>
1. What is the actual problem being asked?
2. What constraints must the solution respect?
3. What are the possible approaches?
4. Which approach is best and why?
</thinking>

Give your final answer in <answer> tags only.
```

## Template F — Few-Shot
[REQ] Format replication. Use 2-5 edge-case examples. Wrap in XML.
```
[Task instruction]

Here are examples of the exact format needed:

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>[example input 1]</input>
    <output>[example output 1]</output>
  </example>
</examples>

Now apply this exact pattern to: [actual input]
```

## Template G — File-Scope
[REQ] Cursor/IDE code editing. Prevents editing wrong file.
```
File: [exact/path/to/file.ext]
Function/Component: [exact name]

Current Behavior:
[What this code does right now — be specific]

Desired Change:
[What it should do after the edit — be specific]

Scope:
Only modify [function / component / section].
Do NOT touch: [list everything to leave unchanged]

Constraints:
- Language/framework: [specify version]
- Do not add dependencies not in [package.json / requirements.txt]
- Preserve existing [type signatures / API contracts / variable names]

Done When:
[Exact condition that confirms the change worked correctly]
```

## Template H — ReAct + Stop Conditions
[REQ] Autonomous agents (Claude Code, Devin). Prevents runaway loops.
```
Objective:
[Single, unambiguous goal in one sentence]

Starting State:
[Current file structure / codebase state / environment]

Target State:
[What should exist when the agent is done]

Allowed Actions:
- [Specific action the agent may take]
- Install only packages listed in [requirements.txt / package.json]

Forbidden Actions:
- Do NOT modify files outside [directory/scope]
- Do NOT run the dev server or deploy
- Do NOT push to git
- Do NOT delete files without showing a diff first
- Do NOT make architecture decisions without human approval

Stop Conditions:
Pause and ask for human review when:
- A file would be permanently deleted
- A new external service or API needs to be integrated
- Two valid implementation paths exist and the choice affects architecture
- An error cannot be resolved in 2 attempts
- The task requires changes outside the stated scope

Checkpoints:
After each major step, output: ✅ [what was completed]
At the end, output a full summary of every file changed.
```

## Template I — Visual Descriptor
[REQ] Image/Video generation (Midjourney, DALL-E, Sora).
```
Subject: [Main subject — specific, not vague]
Action/Pose: [What the subject is doing]
Setting: [Where the scene takes place]
Style: [photorealistic / cinematic / anime / oil painting / vector / etc.]
Mood: [dramatic / serene / eerie / joyful / etc.]
Lighting: [golden hour / studio / neon / overcast / candlelight / etc.]
Color Palette: [dominant colors or named palette]
Composition: [wide shot / close-up / aerial / Dutch angle / etc.]
Aspect Ratio: [16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16 / 4:3]
Negative Prompts: [blurry, watermark, extra fingers, distortion, low quality]
Style Reference: [artist / film / aesthetic reference if applicable]
```

## Template J — Reference Image Editing
[REQ] Modify existing image. Ask user to attach image first.
```
Reference image: [attached / URL]
What to keep exactly the same: [list everything that must not change]
What to change: [specific edit only — be precise]
How much to change: [subtle / moderate / significant]

Negative prompt: [what to avoid introducing]
```

## Template K — ComfyUI
[REQ] ComfyUI node workflows.
```
POSITIVE PROMPT:
[subject], [style], [mood], [lighting], [composition], [quality boosters: highly detailed, sharp focus, 8k]

NEGATIVE PROMPT:
[what to exclude: blurry, low quality, watermark, extra limbs, bad anatomy, distorted, oversaturated]

CHECKPOINT: [model name]
SAMPLER: Euler a (recommended starting point)
CFG SCALE: 7 (increase for stricter prompt adherence)
STEPS: 20-30
RESOLUTION: [width x height — must be divisible by 64]
```

## Template L — Prompt Decompiler
[REQ] Break down, adapt, or split existing prompts.
```
Original prompt: [paste]

Structure analysis:
- Role/Identity: [what role is assigned and why]

```

## Template M — Opus 4.7 Task Brief
[REQ] Complex, agentic tasks for Opus 4.7.
```
## Objective
[What needs to be built, fixed, or produced — one clear sentence. Add WHY if it affects approach.]

## Context
[What exists now — relevant files, current behavior, stack already in place, what was tried and failed]

## Target State
[What done looks like — specific files changed, behavior produced, tests passing. Binary where possible.]

## Scope
- Work only in: [specific files and directories]
- Do NOT touch: [forbidden files — .env, package-lock.json, configs, anything outside scope]

## Constraints
- [Stack version, naming conventions, no new dependencies without asking]
- Only make changes directly requested. Do not add features, abstractions, or files beyond what was asked.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Binary check 1]
- [ ] [Binary check 2]
- [ ] [Binary check 3]

## Stop Conditions
Stop and ask before:
- Deleting any file

```

## Template N — Phased Execution
[REQ] Very large/complex tasks requiring human checkpoints.
```
Objective: [Describe the overarching goal of the large project]

To ensure high quality and prevent loss of focus, we will execute this project in [X] distinct phases.

Phase 1: [Description of the first phase, e.g., Planning and Outline]
Phase 2: [Description of the second phase, e.g., Core Structure / Draft]

CRITICAL RULE:
You must ONLY execute Phase 1 right now. Do NOT begin Phase 2 or any subsequent phase.
When you finish Phase 1, stop and ask: "Is this phase approved, or do you need changes before we move to Phase 2?"
```
