[SKILL] legal-compliance
[OBJ] Align products and code with legal, privacy, and compliance requirements.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] Data mapping first: inventory what personal data is collected, where it flows (third parties, logs, analytics, backups), legal basis per processing purpose, retention schedule, and deletion mechanics — before writing a single policy.
2. [REQ] Privacy by jurisdiction: GDPR (lawful basis, DSRs in 30 days, DPIAs for high-risk, EU residency), CCPA/CPRA (opt-out of sale/share, GPC signal), PIPEDA, plus sector rules (HIPAA/PCI/GLBA/FERPA) when the product touches regulated data.
3. [REQ] Consent that counts: granular, affirmative, revocable (withdrawal as easy as grant), records kept; no dark patterns — pre-ticked boxes and forced bundling fail GDPR/ePrivacy.
4. [REQ] User rights machinery: access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection — each needs an operational path (not just policy text): find the data across all systems, deliver/delete it, and prove it.
5. [REQ] Minimization & retention: collect only what the purpose needs; retention schedules with enforced deletion; anonymization vs pseudonymization distinguished correctly (pseudo is still personal data).
6. [REQ] Vendor & transfer controls: DPAs with processors, SCCs/adequacy for cross-border transfers, sub-processor lists maintained, subprocessors' security postures assessed.
7. [REQ] Licensing audit: classify every dependency (permissive vs copyleft vs source-available), GPL/AGPL reach understood (network copyleft!), attribution/NOTICE obligations met, license policy enforced in CI (license-checker/FOSSA), no copy-paste from license-incompatible sources.
8. [REQ] IP hygiene: CLA/DCO for contributions, AI-generated code assessed for provenance, trademarks checked before naming, employee/contractor IP assignment verified.
9. [REQ] Accessibility compliance: WCAG 2.2 AA mapped to legal exposure per market (ADA/EN 301 549/AODA/EAA June 2025 enforcement) — flag gaps with remediation priority.
10. [REQ] Compliance artifacts: evidence mapped to controls (SOC 2/ISO 27001 scope-aware), risk register with owners, audit trail retention, incident/breach notification paths (72h GDPR clock) documented and drilled.
11. [REQ] Marketing compliance: CAN-SPAM/CASL/GDPR email consent, claims substantiation, affiliate disclosure (FTC), cookie consent before non-essential trackers.
12. [PROHIBIT] Providing definitive legal advice — flag when human counsel is required; copy-pasted privacy policies that don't match actual data flows; or "we'll add compliance later" on products already collecting data.
