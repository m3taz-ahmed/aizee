[SKILL] api-versioning
[OBJ] Design and maintain APIs with clear versioning strategies that preserve backward compatibility and provide predictable deprecation paths.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] Support at least one explicit versioning strategy: URI versioning (e.g. /v1/), header versioning (e.g. Accept-Version), query parameter (e.g. ?api-version=), or content negotiation (Accept header media types).
2. [REQ] Use semantic versioning (semver) for all API releases; bump the major version for any breaking change, minor for additive, patch for fixes.
3. [REQ] Maintain backward compatibility within a major version; never introduce a breaking change without a new major version.
4. [REQ] Know what breaks: removing/renaming fields or endpoints, changing types or semantics, tightening validation, new required parameters, shrinking enum sets, changing defaults, pagination format changes — ALL are breaking. Adding optional fields/endpoints/enum values is safe.
5. [REQ] Choose strategy by audience: URI (/v1) for public APIs (visible, cacheable, simplest); header/media-type for platforms where URL cleanliness matters; don't mix strategies — pick one and document it.
6. [REQ] Prefer evolution over versioning: design so changes are additive (optional params, new endpoints, new fields); each avoided major version is a migration nobody has to run. Version only when the contract truly breaks.
7. [REQ] Provide a deprecation window of minimum 6 months between announcing deprecation and removing functionality.
8. [REQ] Emit Sunset and Deprecation HTTP headers on deprecated endpoints with the scheduled removal date.
9. [REQ] Publish versioned documentation so each major version has its own complete reference; do not overwrite prior version docs.
10. [REQ] Maintain a per-version changelog documenting additions, deprecations, fixes, and breaking changes for every release.
11. [REQ] Consumer evidence: contract tests generated from the spec run in CI (Dredd/Schemathesis/Pact); usage metrics per version per consumer tracked — retirement requires data showing traffic drained, not a calendar date alone.
12. [REQ] GraphQL exception: evolution over versions — deprecate fields (`@deprecated`), never remove without a usage audit; schema changes additive; breaking changes still need a coordinated client migration.
13. [CMD] Announce deprecations through release notes, response headers, and developer communication channels simultaneously.
14. [CMD] Run old and new versions in parallel during the deprecation window so clients can migrate incrementally.
15. [CMD] Track per-version usage metrics to confirm adoption of the new version before retiring the old one.
16. [PROHIBIT] Shipping unversioned breaking changes that silently alter existing client contracts.
17. [PROHIBIT] Removing fields, parameters, or endpoints without first marking them deprecated and serving a deprecation window.
