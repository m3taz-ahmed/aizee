[SKILL] backend-api-expert
[OBJ] Build secure, scalable, evolvable backend services.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] API architecture: design REST/GraphQL/gRPC endpoints with strict OpenAPI/AsyncAPI documentation. Choose REST for resources, GraphQL for graph-shaped client needs, gRPC for high-throughput internal calls — justify the choice.
2. [REQ] Layering: controllers/routers stay thin — parse input, call service, shape output. Business rules live in services/domain objects; persistence behind repositories. Dependency direction: web → service → domain; never inverted.
3. [REQ] Data integrity: transactions around multi-write operations, unique constraints at the DB level (not just app code), optimistic locking or explicit conflict handling for concurrent updates.
4. [REQ] Idempotency: mutating endpoints that clients retry must accept idempotency keys or be naturally idempotent. Webhooks and consumers must dedupe — delivery is at-least-once.
5. [REQ] AuthZ depth: authenticate once at the edge, authorize per resource inside handlers. Object-level checks (BOLA/IDOR) are the #1 API vulnerability — test them explicitly.
6. [REQ] Error contract: consistent error shape (RFC 9457 problem+json or equivalent), machine-readable `code`, no stack traces or internals in responses. 4xx = client fault, retryable info included; 5xx = ours, logged with trace id.
7. [REQ] Pagination & filtering: cursor-based for large/real-time sets, offset acceptable for small admin lists. Always bound page size. Document sort stability.
8. [REQ] Rate limiting & abuse: per-user/IP limits, 429 + Retry-After, stricter limits on expensive endpoints (auth, search, exports). Separate quotas from abuse protection.
9. [REQ] File handling: stream uploads (never buffer to memory), validate content-type + magic bytes + size, store outside web root or in object storage, serve via signed URLs, scan async for user content.
10. [REQ] Async work: anything slower than ~2s or failure-prone (emails, exports, third-party calls) moves to a queue with retries + dead-letter + correlation id. HTTP request returns 202 + status handle.
11. [REQ] N+1 discipline: eager-load relationships; count queries in tests for hot endpoints. Connection pooling sized to actual concurrency; statement timeouts always set.
12. [REQ] Config & secrets: 12-factor — env-driven config, secrets from a manager (never repo), separate config per environment, no environment checks scattered in logic.
13. [REQ] Observability: structured logs with request id, /healthz + /readyz, metrics for RED (rate, errors, duration) per endpoint, trace propagation headers honored.
14. [REQ] Node.js specifics: `async/await` everywhere (no callback mixing), `Promise.allSettled` for fan-out, worker_threads for CPU-bound work (never block the loop), `AbortSignal` threading for cancellation. Fastify > Express for new services; Zod/TypeBox at the boundary.
15. [REQ] Python specifics: type the boundary (Pydantic/attrs), sync/async chosen per workload (don't run blocking calls on a loop), contextvars for request context, gunicorn/uvicorn workers sized to memory not just CPU.
16. [REQ] Versioning & evolution: additive changes freely; breaking changes behind a version seam. Deprecation = Sunset header + docs + migration window, then monitor usage before removal.
17. [CMD] Delegate endpoint surface design (REST vs GraphQL strategy, versioning policy, error model) to `api-architect`; security audits to `security-lord`.
18. [PROHIBIT] Business logic inside route handlers/serializers, unbounded queries (`SELECT *` + no LIMIT), secrets in code, swallowing exceptions into 200s, or retries without backoff+jitter.
