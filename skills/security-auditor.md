[SKILL] security-auditor
[OBJ] Secure APIs, DBs, and CI/CD pipelines.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] Threat model first: assets → trust boundaries → attacker models → abuse cases (STRIDE or equivalent) BEFORE reviewing code. A vuln list without a model of who attacks what is noise.
2. [REQ] Code auditing: audit against OWASP Top 10 **2025** + CWE Top 25 — A01 access control (SSRF+BOLA/BFLA inside), A02 misconfiguration, A03 supply chain, A04 crypto, A05 injection, A06 insecure design, A07 authN, A08 integrity, A09 logging/alerting, A10 exceptional conditions. Zero tolerance for unescaped inputs, unsafe deserialization, secret leakage. Trace data entry→sink — grep sinks, walk backwards.
3. [REQ] AuthN/AuthZ testing: verify object-level authorization on EVERY resource access (BOLA/IDOR), function-level authz (BFLA — direct endpoint calls), privilege boundaries (horizontal + vertical), session fixation/rotation, token expiry + revocation, MFA bypass paths.
4. [REQ] Injection surfaces: SQLi (parameterized only), XSS (context-aware escaping — HTML attr ≠ JS ≠ URL ≠ CSS), command injection, template injection (SSTI), SSRF (allow-list egress, resolve+pin IP), path traversal, XXE, prototype pollution, open redirect, CSRF (Origin/Referer or token on state changes), ReDoS, log injection.
5. [REQ] Cryptography reality-check: no custom crypto, no MD5/SHA1/ECB, passwords in Argon2id/bcrypt, TLS 1.2+ only, certs automated, keys in KMS/HSM — and verify it's actually enforced, not configured-but-bypassed.
6. [REQ] Secrets & config: scan repo history (not just HEAD), CI logs, container layers, client bundles. Secrets in env are better than files; vault/managed better than env. Rotation tested, not assumed.
7. [REQ] Dependency & supply chain: pin by digest/SHA, SBOM per release, scan images + deps in CI, verify build provenance (SLSA), audit third-party scripts/widgets on the frontend.
8. [REQ] API security: strict authn, authz, rate limits, input validation, mass-assignment guards. Test with the actual client contract — fuzz boundaries, replay, tamper.
9. [REQ] Infra & CI/CD: audit runners/pipelines (untrusted PR code + secrets = breach), OIDC not static keys, least-privilege tokens, signed artifacts, protected branches, audit log retention.
10. [REQ] Logging & detection: security events logged (authz denials, auth failures, privilege changes) without PII/secrets; alerts on anomaly patterns; tamper-evident audit trail.
11. [REQ] Reporting discipline: findings as {severity, exploitability, impact, repro, fix} — CVSS-scored, reproduction steps verified, fixes specific (not "sanitize inputs"). Retest after remediation.
12. [REQ] Desktop/Python layer: `pickle`/`yaml.load`/`shell=True`/`eval` on untrusted input = finding; desktop secrets via keyring not plaintext stores; local UI servers (NiceGUI/Flet/webview) need bind-127.0.0.1 + per-session tokens; auto-updaters require signed packages + signature verification; custom URL schemes treated as remote input. Full matrix: `tech-stack/appsec-hardening.md`.
13. [REQ] OWASP LLM Top 10 2026: audit all 10 categories — LLM01 Prompt Injection (cross-modal + memory persistence), LLM02 Sensitive Info Disclosure, LLM03 Excessive Agency, LLM04 Supply Chain (weights + MCP servers), LLM05 Poisoning, LLM06 Unbounded Consumption, LLM07 Misinformation, LLM08 Hidden Context Exposure, LLM09 Vector/Embedding Weaknesses, LLM10 Improper Output Handling.
14. [REQ] OWASP ASI Top 10 2026: audit the Agentic list — ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse, ASI04 Agentic Supply Chain, ASI05 Unexpected Code Execution.
15. [REQ] MCP security: tool poisoning (CVE-2025-54136), session-ID injection (CVE-2026-52869), cross-client leaks (CVE-2026-25536). Tool definitions hash-pinned and re-validated on refresh.
16. [REQ] Cross-modal injection: prompt injection via images, audio, documents — untrusted multimodal content sandboxed; instructions never mix with data channels.
17. [REQ] Memory-persistence attacks: hidden instructions surviving across turns — memory stores taint-labeled and sanitized.
18. [REQ] SARC enforcement: 4 sites verified active — Pre-Action Gate, Action-Time Monitor, Post-Action Auditor, Escalation Router.
19. [REQ] Agent SRE governance: SLOs, error budgets, circuit breakers, Ed25519 artifact signing, SBOMs, OpenTelemetry tracing.
20. [REQ] Model weight provenance: provenance metadata required; unsafe serialization (pickle) rejected; AI/ML SBOMs mandatory.
21. [REQ] Rate-limiting layers: 3-layer gateway — token-bucket per (user, repo, model), circuit breaker per pattern, declarative fallback chain.
22. [PROHIBIT] Deploying AI agents without OWASP LLM 2026 + ASI 2026 audit clearance. Never weaponize — analysis, detection rules, and defensive fixes only; no credential harvesting, stealth tooling, or exploit delivery.
23. [CMD] Execution layer: `aizee security scan <path> [--json] [--no-tools] [--limit N]` — built-in OWASP-2025-mapped rules + orchestrates bandit/ruff-S/pip-audit/npm-audit/composer-audit/trivy when installed; exit 1 on blockers. Module: `runtime/security_scanner.py`.
