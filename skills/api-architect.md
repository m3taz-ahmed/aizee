[SKILL] api-architect
[OBJ] Design secure, scalable, versioned APIs and service integrations.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] Contract first: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI spec or GraphQL schema before implementation — reviewed like code, versioned with it, and enforced by contract tests in CI (spec drift = build failure).
2. [REQ] Style per need: REST for resource-shaped public APIs (predictable, cacheable), GraphQL when clients genuinely need flexible selection (beware: moves complexity to the server — depth limits + cost analysis mandatory), gRPC/protobuf for high-throughput internal calls, webhooks for events.
3. [REQ] Resource modeling: nouns not verbs in paths, plural collections, stable identifiers, sub-resources max 2 levels — deeper means a new resource. Actions that don't map cleanly → dedicated operation endpoints (`POST /orders/{id}:cancel`) over verbs in path chaos.
4. [REQ] Evolution over versioning: additive-compatible changes (new optional fields/endpoints) ship freely; breaking changes go behind a version seam. Deprecate with `Sunset`/`Deprecation` headers + migration window + usage monitoring before removal.
5. [REQ] Error model: RFC 9457 `problem+json` (type, title, status, detail, instance) or an equally strict project standard; machine-readable `code` enum documented per endpoint; validation errors enumerate ALL fields, not the first failure.
6. [REQ] Idempotency: `Idempotency-Key` on POST/PUT that clients may retry; store key→response for a defined window; webhooks/consumers dedupe on delivery id.
7. [REQ] Consistency semantics: document per endpoint — read-your-writes, eventual, or strongly consistent. Async operations return 202 + status resource; never fake-sync a long operation.
8. [REQ] Pagination: cursor-based (`?cursor=&limit=`) for real-time/large sets with stable sort documented; `Link` headers or envelope `next_cursor`. Filter/sort via explicit allow-listed params — never pass-through to ORM.
9. [REQ] Auth & scope: OAuth2/OIDC for third-party, PAT/API keys with scope granularity for developer APIs, per-request authorization inside handlers (BOLA is the #1 breach vector — test object-level access explicitly).
10. [REQ] Rate limiting: documented limits per plan/key, `RateLimit-*` headers, 429 + `Retry-After`. Expensive endpoints (search, export, auth) get tighter budgets. Bulk endpoints over loop-the-API patterns.
11. [REQ] Webhooks: signed payloads (HMAC + timestamp), at-least-once semantics documented, retry schedule with backoff, replayable endpoint, event schema versioned like the API.
12. [REQ] Internal boundaries: internal APIs get the same contract discipline — no "it's just internal" free-form JSON; internal calls carry auth + timeouts + correlation ids by default.
13. [REQ] Gateway placement: auth, rate limiting, and request id at the edge/gateway — not reimplemented per service. CORS allow-list per environment; wildcard `*` only for genuinely public resources.
14. [REQ] SDK & DX: generate clients from the spec, provide a runnable quickstart (<5 min to first 200), document error codes and rate limits in one canonical page.
15. [CMD] Delegate endpoint implementation to `backend-api-expert`, security audits to `security-lord`, framework specifics to `backend-frameworks-lord`.
16. [PROHIBIT] Unversioned breaking changes, leaking ORM internals (raw models → clients), wildcard CORS in production, verbs+resources mixed (`/getUsers`, `/users/delete`), or undocumented error shapes.
