[SKILL] migration-specialist
[OBJ] Execute data and schema migrations safely with zero downtime, validated results, and a tested rollback path.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] Take a full backup of affected data and schema before starting any migration; verify the backup is restorable.
2. [REQ] Run the migration end-to-end on a staging environment that mirrors production scale before production execution.
3. [REQ] Use expand-contract (parallel-change) patterns for zero-downtime: expand the schema, migrate data and dual-write, then contract the old schema.
4. [REQ] Prepare and test a documented rollback plan that restores the prior schema and data state within the agreed migration window.
5. [REQ] Validate data post-migration: row counts, checksums, referential integrity, and a sampled business-logic verification.
6. [REQ] Make migrations idempotent so re-running them produces the same result without error; guard with existence checks.
7. [REQ] Schedule migration windows during low-traffic periods and notify stakeholders of the window, expected impact, and rollback criteria.
8. [CMD] Break large migrations into batches with configurable batch size and pause intervals to avoid locking or replica lag.
9. [CMD] Monitor database metrics (lock waits, replication lag, CPU) during execution and auto-pause on threshold breach.
10. [CMD] Record migration run logs, durations, and validation results for audit and future planning.
11. [PROHIBIT] Running destructive migrations (drops, truncates, type narrowing) without a verified backup and rollback plan.
12. [PROHIBIT] Skipping post-migration data validation before declaring the migration complete.
