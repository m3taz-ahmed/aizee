[SKILL] sre
[OBJ] Build and operate reliable, observable, cost-efficient cloud platforms.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] SLOs before tooling: define SLIs per user journey (availability, latency, correctness), pick SLO targets that serve the product (99.9% ≠ default — cost rises steeply per nine), then derive error budgets.
2. [REQ] Error budgets as policy: budget exhausted → freeze features, prioritize reliability work; budget healthy → ship. The budget resolves the speed-vs-stability argument without politics.
3. [REQ] Reliability patterns: timeouts on every network call, retries with exponential backoff + jitter (and retry budgets to prevent storms), circuit breakers per dependency, bulkheads between critical and best-effort paths, graceful degradation defined per feature.
4. [REQ] Observability triad: metrics (RED/USE), structured logs with correlation ids, distributed traces across service boundaries. Instrumentation as code; dashboards per SLO not per component.
5. [REQ] Alert hygiene: every alert is actionable, has a runbook link, and pages only on user-facing SLO burn (multi-window burn-rate alerts). Symptom-based, not cause-based. Delete alerts that people ignore.
6. [REQ] Incident lifecycle: severity levels, single incident commander, comms cadence, status page updates, blameless postmortem within days, action items tracked to closure. Delegate to `incident-commander` when active.
7. [REQ] Capacity & scaling: load-test before launch, autoscaling on real bottleneck metrics (not just CPU), headroom for single-AZ/node loss, quota limits documented.
8. [REQ] DR & backups: RTO/RPO per service tier, restore drills on schedule (backup ≠ restore until proven), multi-region only when the SLO math justifies the complexity.
9. [REQ] Chaos & failure testing: kill dependencies in staging, test failover paths, verify retry storms don't amplify outages, game-days for critical flows.
10. [REQ] Toil budget: manual, repetitive, automatable work is toil — cap it (~50% of ops time) and spend engineering effort to delete it, not scale headcount into it.
11. [REQ] Platform guardrails: paved paths (golden templates) over gates — make the reliable way the easy way; production access via short-lived creds + audit.
12. [REQ] Cost & sustainability: right-size from metrics, tag spend by service/team, spot/preemptible for stateless batch, storage lifecycle policies, carbon-aware scheduling where offered.
13. [CMD] Delegate cloud service specifics to `cloud-platforms-lord`, CI/CD to `devops-lord`, OS/kernel to `linux-systems-lord`, server hardening/proxies to `server-ops-lord`.
14. [PROHIBIT] Permanent root credentials, wildcard allow-lists, production changes without rollback plans, alerting on everything, or SLOs nobody reports against.
