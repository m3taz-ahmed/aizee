# `skills/` — Persona & Lord Skills

This directory contains **142 skills** (100 directory-based `SKILL.md` + 42 flat `.md` = 142 logical skills; `glob skills/**/*.md` returns ~300 files because directory skills have `references/` and `templates/`). Each skill is a compact rule set loaded lazily — only matching skills enter the AI's context window.

## New Skills (2026-08-28) — Imported from Claude Code Ecosystem

| Skill | Type | Persona | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `web-design-guidelines` | flat | UX | 100+ rules from Vercel (a11y, forms, dark mode, typography, animation, images, performance, navigation, touch, i18n) |
| `design-taste` | flat | UX | Design DNA extractor — reverse-engineer any website's design taste via Playwright |

## How It Works

```
Task description → PersonaDetector → primary persona + secondary personas
                → SkillResolver   → matching skills + lord skills
```

Skills are loaded via `runtime/skill_resolver.py::SkillResolver` which scans both
flat `.md` files and directory-based `SKILL.md` files.

## Skill Formats

### Flat Skills (`skills/<name>.md`)
Single-file skills with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does.
triggers: [keyword1, keyword2]
personas: [ARCH, SEC]
---
[SKILL] my-skill
[OBJ] Objective.
[RULES]
1. [REQ] First rule.
```

### Directory Skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
Multi-file skills with references and templates:
```
skills/seo-lord/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill definition
├── references/           # Supporting reference docs
└── templates/            # Output templates
```

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>.md` (flat) or `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (directory).
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `triggers`, `personas`, `tech_stack`.
3. Register in `PERSONA_SKILLS` mapping in `runtime/persona.py` if persona-linked.
4. Test: `aizee persona detect --multi "<task description>"`.
5. Run `aizee memory ingest` to refresh indexes.
6. Run `python scripts/sync_docs.py` to update count in docs.

> **Note:** `skills/seo-content-generator.md` was removed (superseded by `skills/seo-lord/`).
