# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added (DeepTutor adoption round 2)

- **Context-composition telemetry** (`runtime/context_composition.py`):
  per-call readout of what fills the model's context window — named
  segments (system/messages/tools/prompt), shares of total + window,
  over-budget flag, dominant segment, degraded-counter safety. Wired into
  the gateway's `_gate` so every governed `LLMRequest` audits
  `context_total`/`context_utilization`/`context_dominant`; providers gain
  an optional `context_window` field in `gateway.yaml`.
- **Inventory facts** (`runtime/inventory_note.py`): plain-fact install
  counts (skills/workflows/tech-stack/memory banks/plugins) rendered for
  prompt injection — inventory questions answerable without a tool call
  (DeepTutor manifest pattern). `aizee inventory [--report|--json]`.
- **Plugin state transactions** (`runtime/plugin_transactions.py`):
  nonblocking lockfile-serialized mutations of `plugins.yaml` (msvcrt on
  Windows, fcntl on POSIX) + atomic write-back; contention raises
  `PluginStateError` instead of silently serializing.
  `aizee plugin enable|disable <name>`.
- **Document skills**: `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx` — conditional
  (trigger-routed) format skills covering extract/create/edit with the
  python toolchain (python-docx, pypdf/pdfplumber/PyMuPDF/reportlab,
  python-pptx, openpyxl/pandas).
- **Distribution**: `requirements/{base,dev,graphify,vector}.txt` mirrors
  of pyproject extras, `MANIFEST.in` for sdist completeness (skills/,
  workflows/, tech-stack/, docs/), `[project.urls]` metadata. Wheel
  verified building (`aizee-6.5.0-py3-none-any.whl`).

## [6.5.0] - 2026-10-26 (Star-Repos Adoption Pass — artemis / agent-reach / OpenSpec / DeepTutor / free-claude-code / paperless)

Features adopted from a structured study of 16 open-source agent repos
(full matrix: `.ai/star-repos-report.md`), plus REA (morluto/rea, MIT)
integration and Arabic persona-detection fixes.

### Added (star-repos adoption)

- **Structured doctor engine** (`runtime/doctor.py`): machine-readable
  `verdict` (`ready`/`degraded`/`blocked`) + ordered `next_steps` where
  automatable fixes carry `run` commands and manual steps carry `guidance`.
  `aizee doctor --json` emits the report; the new **`aizee_doctor` MCP
  tool** exposes the same truth to agents (artemis pattern).
- **Uniform MCP response envelope** (`runtime/tool_envelope.py`):
  `{schema_version:"aizee.tool.v1", ok, tool, result, error:{code}, meta}`
  with stable error codes (`NEED_SETUP`, `POLICY_DENIED`,
  `UPSTREAM_BROKEN`, `BAD_INPUT`, ...) + `meta.update` when
  `state/update_available.json` exists (Agent-Reach pattern).
- **NL discovery** (`runtime/find.py`): `aizee find "<need>"` ranks
  skills/workflows/tech-stack by token relevance; `aizee goal
  "<objective>"` maps a goal to the best workflow + its step list.
  Both exposed as MCP tools `aizee_find`/`aizee_goal` (hackingtool pattern).
- **Verification-depth dial** (`runtime/verification.py`):
  `Kernel.act(..., verify="off|final|checkpoints|strict")` layers plan-diff
  and supply-chain checks on top of the mandatory six gates — the gates
  are never removed (artemis pattern, fail-closed).
- **Governed LLM gateway** (`runtime/gateway_proxy.py`): localhost
  Anthropic/OpenAI-surface proxy with an ordered provider failover chain
  and `kernel.act` enforcement on every request — governance inside the
  traffic path, not around it (free-claude-code + ds2api pattern).
  `aizee gateway init|serve`.
- **OpenSpec-style change folders** (`runtime/spec/changes.py`):
  `aizee spec propose <name>` scaffolds
  `specs/changes/<name>/{proposal,design,tasks}.md`; `aizee spec changes`
  lists progress; `aizee spec archive <name>` lands it under
  `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`.
- **Memory consume-rules** (`runtime/ingest_rules.py`): `rules/ingest.yaml`
  maps root-relative globs to `bank`/`kind`/`tags`; `memory ingest` routes
  matched files into banks (paperless-ngx consume pipeline).
- **Config ops** (`runtime/config_ops.py`): `aizee config show` masks
  secret-looking values; `aizee config apply <file> --check` validates +
  previews the exact diff without writing (DeepTutor pattern).
- **`aizee models`**: prints the model routing catalog (tier, provider,
  cost, context).
- **`aizee work poll`**: lists open GitHub issues via `gh`, ranking
  unassigned + help-wanted first (cua pull-model).
- **Root `SKILL.md` + `aizee skill link`**: aiZee now ships as an
  installable skill for other agent harnesses (cursor/claude/codex/
  opencode).
- **`llms.txt`**: LLM-facing repo index at root.
- **Token-efficiency output filter** (`runtime/output_filter.py`):
  opt-in via `AIZEE_OUTPUT_FILTER=1`; collapses boilerplate in large MCP
  tool results before they reach the model, audited to the log.

### Added (star-repos batch 2 — agentmemory / browser-use / OpenViking / anthropic-cybersecurity-skills / scientific-agent-skills / mimic)

- **Skill authoring toolchain** (`runtime/skill_lint.py`): `aizee skill
  lint` checks every skill description (length, trigger phrasing,
  reachability), detects trigger/name collisions with family-token
  awareness (lord/architect families don't compete), respects negative
  triggers, and regenerates `skills/index.json` (`--write-index`).
- **Skill security scanner** (`runtime/skill_scan.py`): `aizee skill
  scan` flags prompt-injection phrasing, exfil channels, remote
  pipe-to-shell, credential requests, eval/destructive patterns — high
  findings fail the scan (Cisco skill-scanner pattern, offline).
- **Tiered context loading** (`runtime/abstracts.py`): L0 abstract
  sidecars generated per skill/tech-stack/workflow file
  (`aizee abstract`), L1 overview read, L2 full — agents check relevance
  before paying for content (OpenViking L0/L1/L2).
- **Agent-harness hooks** (`runtime/hooks.py`): `aizee hooks install`
  wires session_start/post_tool_failure/pre_compact/session_end into
  Claude Code `.claude/settings.json` + portable `.aizee/hooks/*.sh`;
  `aizee hooks fire <event>` runs context-injecting (stdout) or
  fire-and-forget telemetry handlers (agentmemory pattern).
- **Sensitive-data vault** (`runtime/sensitive.py`): secrets reference
  `{NAME}` placeholders; `SensitiveVault.inject` resolves at call time,
  `mask`/`mask_dict` redact before gates/audit.
  `Kernel.act(..., sensitive_data={...})` masks action args
  automatically (browser-use pattern).
- **Governed API session** (`runtime/api_session.py`): replay a
  captured auth bundle — `from_curl`, `from_har`, `from_headers` —
  filtered through keep/drop header rules; every request passes
  `kernel.act` before dispatch with masked headers (mimic adoption).
  `aizee session from-curl|from-har` inspects bundles.
- **Gateway provider tiers**: providers may declare `tiers: [flash,
  extraction]`; requests carrying `tier` route to dedicated cheap/fast
  providers first, untiered fallbacks after (browser-use
  small-model-split).
- **Capture-time secret scrubbing** (`runtime/secret_scrub.py`):
  memory ingest scrubs assigned secrets, known token prefixes, and
  Authorization headers before persistence (agentmemory pattern).
- **`plugin.json`**: agentskills.io Agent Plugins manifest — aiZee
  skills are installable by any spec-compliant host.
- **README `mcp-name` marker** for MCP-registry indexing
  (browser-use pattern).

### Changed

- **`aizee doctor`** now prints a verdict banner + "Next steps" (Run:/
  Guidance:) and exits non-zero on degraded/blocked; removed three stale
  module checks (trajectory/reasoning_graph/context_manager were deleted
  in 6.4.0).
- **AGENTS.md**: added a Worker-Agent Contract section (GitHub is the
  durable record; pull-model work via `aizee work poll`).

### Fixed

- **Arabic persona-detection blind spot:** `runtime/personas.yaml` carried
  Arabic keywords only for marketing/design/CV/freelance personas — every
  engineering persona scored 0.0 on Arabic-only prompts and
  `detect_multiple` always fell back to ARCH. Added Arabic keywords to all
  engineering personas plus Arabic orthography normalization (alef/taa
  variants, diacritics, conjunction prefixes) in `runtime/persona.py`.
- **Dangling `runtime.__all__` exports (70 names):** the skill_routing
  purge left `PersonaDetectorV2`, `SkillRouter`, and ~68 more names in
  `__all__` with no backing module — `from runtime import X` raised
  ImportError while `from runtime import *` exploded. `__all__` now
  advertises only resolvable names.
- **`detect_persona()` hardcoded default:** now uses
  `PersonaDetector.DEFAULT` (personas.yaml) instead of literal `"ARCH"`.
- **Skill-library repair (141 skills, 0 lint issues, 0 collisions):**
  73 unreachable skills gained `triggers:` + `always: true` (frontmatter
  `triggers:` are load-gates in `matches_context` — `always` keeps them
  unconditional); 43 negative triggers disambiguate colliding pairs;
  `skill_lint` gained role-noun family tokens, generic single-word trigger
  filtering, name-token exemption, and `README.md`/`index.json` glob
  exclusion; `secret_scrub` prose-filter stops redacting English words
  after `key:` (`Authorization: Distinguish…`); 5 files with
  unrecoverable Arabic mojibake (`O?U?`) got valid Arabic triggers.
- **`api_session` auth-bundle exfiltration paths:** absolute-URL
  `request()` targets are refused when the host differs from the
  captured `base_url`, and a `_SameHostRedirect` opener blocks urllib's
  default credential-replay on cross-host 302s; `extra_headers` are now
  masked into the `kernel.act` gate call.
- **`gateway_proxy` hardening:** request bodies over 10 MB are rejected
  (400), and the prompt-guardrail scan window grew 4k → 64k chars so
  injected instructions can't hide past the gate.

### Added

- **`runtime/evidence.py`:** `EvidenceTier` (observation / derivation /
  inference / unknown), `Evidence` records, `EvidenceLedger` — provenance
  model adapted from REA. `ScanFinding.evidence_tier` +
  `ScanReport.evidence_summary()` wire it into `security scan` output;
  gitignored-.env downgrades tag DERIVATION, advisory-db findings
  (pip/npm/composer/trivy) tag DERIVATION, pattern matches stay
  OBSERVATION.
- **`AIZEE_MCP_INPUT_SCHEMA_PROFILE=compact`** (`aizee_mcp/schema_profile.py`):
  strips advertised tool input schemas to their validation-relevant core
  (no examples/titles/multi-line guidance) for token-budget-constrained
  clients. `full` remains the default; applied after the manifest lock so
  fingerprints cover the canonical schema.
- **`skills/reverse-engineering-lord/`:** reverse-engineering workflow
  skill adapted from REA's `reverse-engineer-anything` — evidence tiers,
  provider authority boundaries, source-vs-artifact routing.
- **`rea` MCP server registration** in `aizee_mcp/config.json` +
  `plugins.yaml` (`npx -y rea-agents@6.7.0 mcp`) — governed by the same
  firewall/RBAC/gateway gates as other external MCPs.
- **Dry-run JSON plans:** `install.ps1 -PlanJson` and
  `python scripts/update.py --dry-run [--json]` emit exact
  paths/backups/changes/post-install-steps before any mutation.
- **`check_runtime_exports` in `validate-globals.py`:** every `__all__`
  name must resolve through `_LAZY_TABLE` (module file or package must
  exist) or a `runtime/<name>` submodule — the check that would have
  caught the 70-name drift.

### Changed

- **Codemode lifecycle invariants:** child-process cleanup now retries
  `kill()` once and never drops ownership —
  `CodeModeResult.cleanup_pending` reports an unreaped child instead of
  silently succeeding.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-10-15 (Research Integration Pass — ECC / agent-reach / auth-for-laravel)

External-research integration pass (ECC, agent-reach, auth-for-laravel —
selective adoption, no wholesale import), on top of the second
maintenance cycle below.

### Security

- **`security mcp` secret scan deepened:** findings now cover secrets in
  `args` (flag/value pairs), token-shaped values (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`,
  `sk-`, `xox[baprs]-`, `AIza`, `pk_live`, …), unpinned `npx`/`uvx`
  packages, and writable command paths — with redacted values and no
  duplicate reporting when a flag consumes its value.
- **Prompt-defense baseline in emitted rules:** `rules_materializer`
  injects a fixed anti-injection section into every generated harness
  rules file (identity lock, secret non-disclosure, untrusted external
  content, unicode/urgency suspicion) — emitted as text, not counted in
  `rules_emitted`.
- **`fact_force` guardrail in `AgentGateway`:** catastrophic commands
  stay unconditionally blocked; recoverable-but-dangerous operations
  (force-push, hard reset, …) now require explicit `facts` (target +
  rollback) supplied inline or via metadata.

### Added

- **Memory handoffs (`aizee.handoff.v1`):** `aizee memory handoff
  --to-harness <h> --body <md>` writes a portable Markdown doc into the
  scoped vault (`brain/handoffs/`) and indexes it; `handoffs` lists them.
- **Memory scopes + fail-closed vault guard:** `--scope project|user` on
  memory commands; the project vault refuses writes unless `brain/` is
  git-ignored (auto-created/appended; explicit `!brain/` → refuse).
- **Instincts (`aizee.instinct.v1`):** `instinct-add`/`instinct-reinforce`/
  `instincts` — atomic trigger→action pairs with confidence 0.3→0.9;
  observed in ≥2 projects → auto-promotes project→user scope. Built on
  `MemoryStore.update_meta` (re-signs mutated metadata).
- **`tech-stack/auth-for-laravel.md`** and
  **`docs/INSTALL_CONTRACT.md`** (agent-readable `aizee.install.v1`
  boundaries for install/update/uninstall scripts).

### Maintenance cycle (same release)

Periodic evolution pass — second maintenance cycle (see
`implementation_plan.md`, 2026-10-15).

### Security

- **Schema-aware MCP manifest lock:** `_verify_manifest_lock` now
  fingerprints `description + parameters` (input schema) per tool, not the
  description alone — a rug-pull that silently redefines a tool's
  parameters now trips drift detection.
- **`aizee security mcp`:** new subcommand wiring `McpAuditor` (14
  deterministic detectors) against discovered MCP configs
  (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.devin/…`,
  `~/.claude.json`, …) — JSONC-tolerant parsing, `--lock` persists
  rug-pull baselines under `state/mcp_locks/` — the service is now
  cli-wired instead of lazy-only.
- **Undeclared-import detection in `security scan`:** `SupplyChainGuard`
  now runs as a built-in scanner stage over Python/TS/JS/PHP/Go/Rust
  sources — imports missing from the project's declared dependency
  manifests surface as A03 supply-chain findings. The same check is
  available pre-write inside `lint_python` via the new
  `SupplyChainGuard.scan_source` (advisory findings).
- **Scanner dedup:** identical (rule, file, line) hits collapse, and
  bandit/ruff-S flagging the same sink line as each other now report once.
- **Supply-chain false positives fixed:** `SupplyChainGuard` now uses
  `sys.stdlib_module_names` (the authoritative 300+ stdlib list instead of
  a 50-entry subset), recognizes first-party modules (project dirs/`*.py`
  roots, sibling files, go.mod `module` path, composer psr-4 roots), and
  maps import→distribution names (`yaml`↔`pyyaml`, `PIL`↔`pillow`, …).

### Added

- **MCP tool annotations:** 31 registered tools now carry
  `ToolAnnotations` (`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint`/
  `openWorldHint`) via `_annotate_tools()` in `aizee_server.py`, applied
  post-registration alongside the RBAC guard — IDE clients can
  auto-approve safe reads.

### Removed

- **22 orphan runtime modules deleted** with ~33 dedicated test files:
  modules that were exported and tested but had no production call site
  (kept visible under `ORPHAN_MODULES` since v6.2). Two list entries were
  mislabeled — `budget_escalation` (imported by `budget.py`) and
  `service_catalog` (imported by `agent_discovery.py`) stay;
  `supply_chain_guard`/`mcp_auditor` earned real call sites and stay.
  Canonical count: 129 → 107 modules; everything is retrievable from git
  history if ever needed.

### Fixed

- **Version drift:** `dde73b2` claimed a 6.3.0 bump but `pyproject.toml`
  was left at 6.2.0 — now actually 6.3.0, so `config.VERSION`, MCP
  `clientInfo`, `aizee version`, and doctor all agree.

### Changed

- **Dependencies refreshed within pins:** mcp 2.3.0, pydantic 2.14.1,
  cryptography 50.0.2, turbovec 1.1.2, graphifyy 0.9.91, ruff 0.17.1,
  mypy 2.4.0.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-10-11 (Maintenance Pass — lazy runtime, manifest lock, advisory lint)

Maintenance pass — surgical upgrades from `implementation_plan.md`. All
changes verified by the full quality gate suite.

### Security

- **MCP manifest lock enforced at boot (P0-a):** `aizee_mcp` now locks all
  registered tool manifests (name + description hashes) on first start via
  `ManifestLock` and re-verifies on every subsequent start. Drift is logged
  as a warning by default; `AIZEE_MCP_LOCK=enforce` makes drift fail-closed
  (abort startup). Lock state lives in `state/mcp_locks/`.
- **Advisory lint wiring (P0-b):** `lint_python` now also runs
  `HallucinationDetector` and `StaleApiDetector` over submitted code and
  returns their findings under an `"advisory"` key — hallucinated imports
  and stale API usage surface in the editor before code is written.
- **Scanner hygiene (P0-c):** the intentional sandboxed `exec` in
  `runtime/codemode/_child.py` carries an inline `aizee-scan` suppression;
  empty `except` bodies in the codemode executor now log with context.
  `aizee security scan runtime` reports **0 findings** (+9 suppressed).

### Performance

- **Lazy `runtime` package (P1-a):** `runtime/__init__.py` uses PEP 562
  `__getattr__` + lazy submodule loading. `import runtime` cost drops
  ~0.46s → ~0.01s; every CLI call and test pays it no longer.
- **Lazy kernel services (P1-b):** the 17 constructed-only services
  (manifest lock, detectors, routers, marketing governance) are built on
  first attribute access via `Kernel.__getattr__` instead of eagerly in
  `_init_core_services()`. `Kernel()` init drops ~0.59s → ~0.13s.
  Security-critical stacks (taint, guardrails, injection, design) stay
  eager so strict-mode semantics are unchanged.

### Added

- **Auto-compaction on ingest (P2-b):** `aizee memory ingest` now runs
  `compact_memory()` against `Memory.md` afterwards — when the file
  exceeds its 500-line charter it is compacted in place and dropped
  sections are archived under `memory/archive/`. `aizee memory compact`
  remains available for manual/dry-run use.

### Changed

- **Status truth labels:** lazily-constructed services report `"mcp-lazy"`
  (previously `"constructed"`); `aizee doctor`'s wiring table wording
  updated to match. `status()["constructed_only_services"]` unchanged.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-10-08 (Truth & Termination — audit P0s closed)

The v6.2 milestone closes every P0 from `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md`: the two
critical findings (sandbox escape, root contamination) plus the truth-hygiene
layer (honest `status()`, wiring-aware doctor, synced docs). All changes
verified by the full quality gate suite.

### Security

- **Codemode subprocess isolation (C1 FIXED):** sandboxed source now runs in
  a child process (`runtime/codemode/_child.py`); on timeout the child is
  `kill()`ed — no orphaned thread keeps `call_tool` in scope. Parent-side
  enforcement (`enforce_tool_call_root`) preserved via the call/result proxy.
- **Security-stack strict mode (H3 FIXED):** `AIZEE_SECURITY_STRICT=1` makes
  every kernel init guard fail-closed (raises on load failure). In default
  lenient mode failed stacks are recorded in `kernel.disabled_defenses`,
  surfaced via `status()["disabled_defenses"]` and a red `DEGRADED` line in
  `aizee doctor`.
- **Loud budget quarantine (H4 FIXED):** corrupt/undecryptable `budget.json`
  now logs `ERROR` with the remediation hint and sets
  `budget.state_quarantined` → `status()["budget_state_quarantined"]` + red
  WARNING in doctor. `AIOS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`/`AIOS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`
  documented in `.env.example`.
- **Audit signing wired (P1.2 DONE):** `AuditLogger` accepts `signer=`;
  kernel wires `audit_signer` so every entry is Ed25519-signed.
  `verify_chain()` verifies signatures and reports `signatures_checked`/
  `signatures_unchecked`; `aizee audit verify` exposes it.

### Fixed

- **Test hermeticity (C2 FIXED):** `conftest.py` pins `AIZEE_ROOT` to the
  repo root before kernel/memory imports — the suite can no longer read or
  mutate the deployment mirror. `aizee doctor` prints a divergence note when
  env root ≠ code root. `aizee test` and `eval/harness.py` now execute
  against the tree containing the invoked code (explicit `--root` still
  wins) — previously both silently ran the *mirror's* suite whenever
  `AIZEE_ROOT` pointed at a deployment, which is how the mirror-suite
  results were produced.
- **`status()` truth (H1/P0.3):** constructed-but-uncalled services report
  `"constructed"` (was `"active"`); `policy_linter` reports `"cli-wired"`;
  `constructed_only_services` is exposed machine-readably (source:
  `kernel.CONSTRUCTED_ONLY_SERVICES`).
- **Doctor wiring checks (H5 FIXED):** `aizee doctor` prints a "Module
  wiring (call-site truth)" table — `orphan (no callers)` / `constructed
  only (no callers)` / `absent` from `kernel.ORPHAN_MODULES` — instead of
  treating file existence as a health signal.
- **`aizee policy lint` (NEW):** runs PolicyLinter (PL001–PL007) over
  `runtime/policies/`; findings table + non-zero exit on errors. PL002
  disjunction false-positives fixed (`a==X or a==Y` is no longer a
  contradiction).
- **MCP `clientInfo.version`** now reads `config.VERSION` — can no longer
  drift from the release version.

### Docs / truth sync (M7 FIXED)

- `spec.md`: 201 mypy files, 7637 tests @ 100% enforced coverage (was
  "345 files / 3888 tests / ~69%").
- pyproject coverage comment corrected: floor is 100% (was "pinned to 68%").
- README/AGENTS/rules: 39 enabled MCP tools (was 43), counts resynced via
  `scripts/sync_docs.py` + `scripts/sync-agent-configs.py`.
- `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md`: statuses updated; the incorrect "24 rootless
  `Kernel()` test sites" evidence corrected (real vector: direct env reads).
- `docs/WORLD_CLASS_GAP.md`: P0.1–P0.4 + P1.1–P1.3 marked DONE.

### Version

- 6.2.0 everywhere: `pyproject.toml`, `config.py`, `.aizee-version`,
  `manifest.json`, README badges, `validate-globals.*`.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-10-06 (Lean Surface — fewer MCPs, dead code out, upgrade hygiene)

The v6.1 milestone: the default surface is reduced to what is actually
used. Marketing/social/freelance integrations are gated off (code kept),
dead runtime modules are deleted, and installs/updates remove retired
files from existing setups while preserving `state/`, `brain/`, `.env`.

### Added — external-repo adoptions

- **Memory banks + reflect** (from `vectorize-io/hindsight`): `MemoryStore`
  gained a `bank` namespace column (additive migration, `NOT NULL DEFAULT
  'global'` + `idx_mem_bank`), bank filtering on `search` / `list_all` /
  `count` / `search_as_of` / `search_temporal` / `search_safe`, a `banks()`
  listing, and `reflect()` — deterministic extractive answer synthesis over
  bank-scoped FTS recall, with optional `llm_fn` for real LLM synthesis.
  MCP surface: `search_memory`/`add_memory` accept `bank`; new
  `list_memory_banks` + `reflect_memory` tools. CLI: `aizee memory banks`,
  `aizee memory reflect`, `--bank` flag. Schema contract bumped to `v4`.
- **Skill lifecycle engine** (from `tigerless-labs/autoharness`):
  `runtime/skill_lifecycle.py` — `SkillLifecycleManager` with typed
  lifecycle states, request/view/invoke signals, capacity caps, and
  fold-merge of redundant skill entries; wired into the kernel
  (`kernel.skill_lifecycle`) and `aizee skill lifecycle` CLI.
- **`cli-first-access` skill** (from `Panniantong/agent-reach`): prefer
  native CLIs + real health-probes over standing up MCP servers; the
  documented replacement path for the disabled external integrations.

### Changed — MCP surface slimmed to core

- Canonical registry `aizee_mcp/config.json` reduced to **3 servers**
  (`aizee`, `graphify`, `context7`); all external/social/marketing
  servers removed from the spawn registry.
- `.devin/mcp_config.json` trimmed to the same 3 (dropped
  upwork/freelancer/fiverr/linkedin/refero/mobbin).
- `plugins.yaml`: 31 external-MCP plugins set `enabled: false`;
  only `code2video`, `graphify`, `context7` remain enabled.
- `install.ps1` / `install.sh` generated `.claude/settings.json`
  template trimmed to core servers (no more upwork/freelancer/
  fiverr/linkedin or refero/mobbin alwaysAllow entries).
- Global `%APPDATA%\devin\mcp_config.json` regenerated to match.
- `aizee_mcp/config.json` gained `disabledToolModules` — 7 marketing-domain
  tool modules (`ads_tools`, `analytics_tools`, `cro_tools`, `email_tools`,
  `freelance_tools`, `seo_tools`, `social_tools`) are skipped at both
  auto-discovery and fallback registration. Registered tools: ~102 → 43.
  The modules still ship; remove a name to re-enable it.

### Changed — repository cleanup

- Dead runtime modules deleted (with their tests): `a2a_server`,
  `agentic_security`, `audit_workflow`, `codegraph`, `error_classifier`,
  `provider_registry`, `sarif_emitter`, `semantic_search`, `skill_eval`,
  `sql_injection_guard`, `text_sanitize`, `tool_output_bounder`,
  `tree_sitter_provider`, `plugin_system` (no `plugin.json` manifests
  existed; `runtime/plugin.py` remains the active plugin manager).
- Test tree consolidated: `runtime/tests`, `memory/tests`, `eval/tests`,
  `aizee_mcp/tests` moved under `tests/{runtime,memory,eval,aizee_mcp}/`;
  `pyproject.toml` testpaths, `conftest.py` markers, `sync_docs.py`
  counters, and per-file-ignores updated to match.
- `design-library/` shipped: README + 3 original seed `DESIGN.md` systems
  (editorial, midnight, minimal). `DesignLibrary` no longer silently
  resolves an empty catalog.
- `Memory.md` compacted to 145 lines via `aizee memory compact`
  (older sections archived under `memory/archive/`).
- Version bumped to 6.1.0 everywhere: `pyproject.toml`, `config.py`
  fallback, `manifest.json`, `.aizee-version`, `runtime/mcp_client.py`
  `clientInfo`, `scripts/validate-globals.py`, both READMEs.

### Added — upgrade hygiene

- `scripts/stale_files.txt` — explicit manifest of retired repo paths.
- `install.ps1`, `install.sh`, `scripts/update.py` consume it: install
  and update now delete retired files from existing installs (conservative
  — only listed paths, never user files). `state/`, `brain/`, `.env`,
  `backups/` are always preserved.
- `scripts/update.py` gained `clean_stale_files(root)` — refuses
  path-escaping entries (`..`, absolute paths).

### Fixed

- **MCP disable name-mismatch leak**: `.devin/mcp_config.local.json`
  and `state/settings.json` disabled `google-ads`, `meta-ads`,
  `tiktok-ads`, `linkedin-ads` (hyphens) while servers are registered
  as `google_ads` etc. (underscores) — the toggles never matched, so
  the 4 ads servers stayed live in every IDE session. Renamed to
  underscore form.

### Performance — test suite

- `memory/vector.py`: `sentence_transformers` import moved behind a lazy
  `_resolve_sentence_transformer()` (`_ST_UNSET` sentinel keeps the module
  attribute patchable). Module import no longer pulls transformers+torch
  (~7.6s per process, and per pytest-xdist worker).
- `conftest.py`: GC boot window — `gc.disable()` during collection, then
  `gc.freeze()` + sparse thresholds (50k/20/20) in
  `pytest_collection_modifyitems`; per-test `gc.collect()` amortized to every
  64 tests (was ~0.1s each on a large heap).
- `aizee test` fast tier: `--ignore=` for tests/{mcp,dashboard,e2e} and
  memory/tests/test_vector.py — `-m` deselection still paid their import cost.
- Measured: fast tier 6,712 tests in ~67s with `-n 12` on Windows (was
  15min+); `memory.store` import 8.6s→0.58s; 153-test subset 25s→2.1s.
- `eval/harness.py`: pytest leg now runs with `-n` workers when pytest-xdist
  is installed (pytest-cov merges per-worker coverage automatically).

### Fixed

- `runtime/tests/test_tracing_otel.py::test_noop_without_sdk` — failed when
  `opentelemetry-api` was present as a transitive dep; now simulates absence
  via `sys.modules` + resets the warn-once flag. Removed a stale
  `# type: ignore` in `runtime/tracing_otel.py`.
- `aizee_mcp/agent.py`: `tool.inputSchema` → `tool.input_schema` — the MCP
  SDK model is snake_case; the camelCase attribute would raise
  `AttributeError` at runtime when listing tools.
- `runtime/tests/test_codemode.py`: tool-caller stub now returns
  `dict[str, Any]` to match the `ToolCaller` contract (mypy).
- Ruff cleanup of pre-existing v6 issues: duplicate `CrossToolTaintTracker`
  export, unsorted imports, unused imports/variables in v6 test files.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-09-29 (Governed Runtime — enforcement on the action path)

The v6 milestone: governance controls that existed as standalone modules
are now enforced on the actual execution paths (Kernel.act, inbound MCP
tool dispatch, outbound MCP calls), plus the reliability/memory/tooling
roadmap from the full-project architecture review.

### Added — enforcement on the action path (P0)

- `runtime/enforcement.py` — unified enforcement helper: shared-kernel
  lookup, MCP firewall check, AgentGateway request/response verdicts,
  approval resolution, audit logging, strict/degrade modes.
- `Kernel.act()` now runs AgentGateway checks after Probity — prompt
  injection and secret-leak gates apply to real actions (prompt-like
  fields only; file/doc payloads unaffected).
- `runtime/mcp_client.py` — outbound MCP calls (sync + async) run the
  firewall + gateway pre-call and gateway post-result; `enforce=False`
  opt-out for isolated transports/tests.
- `aizee_mcp/aizee_server.py` — inbound tool dispatch keeps RBAC and is
  additionally wrapped by AgentGateway request/response checks.
- `aizee_mcp/agent.py` — `McpAgent` multi-server path wired the same way.

### Added — detection & protocol (P0)

- `runtime/injection_detector.py` — L2 semantic (embedding-similarity)
  layer + L3 optional LLM-judge hook layered over the 13-technique L1
  detector; structured verdict metadata; deterministic by default.
- `runtime/dual_llm.py` — Pydantic schema for quarantined worker output;
  schema parse failure is fail-safe (validator path unaffected).
- `runtime/mcp_protocol.py` — MCP 2026-07-28 stateless support:
  per-request `protocolVersion` negotiation, dual-era handling,
  `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` header routing helpers.
- `.env` decoding hardened — `errors="replace"` in secret loading; a
  malformed byte can no longer crash MCP startup.

### Added — governance depth (P1)

- APL verdicts: policy actions `modify` (payload rewrite, audited) and
  `observe` (allow + observe metadata) alongside allow/ask/deny.
- `runtime/hook_lifecycle.py` — new phases `output.pre_send` and
  `memory.pre_write`; `Kernel.chat_message` runs output hooks,
  `MemoryStore.add_batch` runs pre-write hooks (veto via context stop).
- `eval/chaos.py` — fault-injection scenarios (latency, exception,
  timeout, rate-limit, partial-data, crash) + error-budget math + report.
- `memory/store.py` — memory lifecycle: `pinned`, `deleted_at`
  soft-delete, `contradiction_of` relations + resolve, additive schema
  migration, HMAC integrity preserved, soft-deleted rows excluded from
  FTS/vector/hybrid/temporal/list/relations paths.
- `runtime/heal.py` + `aizee heal` — safe autofix orchestrator: dry-run
  default, `--apply` with per-fix confirmation (`-y` non-interactive),
  audits to `state/heal.log`. Fixes missing dirs, `.env` encoding,
  version marker, memory schema drift, global MCP config.
- Per-PR spend limits — `Budget` at scope `"pr"` + `check_pr()`; usage
  keyed `pr:<id>` persists across sessions; wired via `pr`/`pr_id` action
  arg or `AIZEE_PR_ID`.
- `eval/release_gate.py` — reliability release gate: priority-ladder
  verdicts over `state/release_rollouts.jsonl`, skips without evidence,
  wired into `aizee ci` (`CIPipeline`).

### Added — v6 strategic (P2)

- `runtime/codemode/` — Code Mode: sandboxed Python snippets that call
  MCP tools via `call_tool()`; AST scan (plugin sandbox reuse) +
  restricted builtins + governed tool bridge + wall-clock timeout;
  `aizee codemode --code/--file`.
- `runtime/a2a_server.py` — A2A server-side exposure: agent card at
  `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, JSON-RPC `tasks/send|get|cancel`,
  task store with JSONL persistence, loopback bind + bearer token
  (SEC-14), task handler routes through the governed kernel.
- `memory/store.py::as_of()` — bi-temporal point-in-time queries:
  transaction time (`created_at`/`deleted_at`) + valid time
  (`valid_from`/`valid_to`).
- `memory/compactor.py` + `aizee memory compact` — Memory.md
  auto-compaction: 500-line budget, newest `[UPDATED]` sections kept,
  `[PINNED]` bullets rescued, dropped sections archived under
  `memory/archive/`, atomic rewrite, dry-run default.
- `runtime/bootstrap.py` + `aizee bootstrap` — PyPI bootstrap path:
  materializes a minimal OS root (dirs + policies + version marker +
  .env.example + optional MCP sync), idempotent, dry-run default.
- `runtime/overengineering.py` — advisory gold-plating audit over the
  active task plan + graphify graph (`aizee task overcheck`).
- `runtime/curriculum.py` — staged curriculum synthesis from
  `tech-stack/` refs (`aizee task curriculum --stack ... [--plan]`).

### Fixed

- `memory/schema_contract.py` — canonical contract updated for
  `pinned`/`deleted_at` (schema-drift verifier false-positive).
- pytest/pytest-cov/graphifyy pin bounds reconciled with installed
  versions; `spec.md` module-count drift corrected.
- `.env` Windows-1252 byte repaired; repo `.env` is valid UTF-8.

## [5.17.0] - 2026-09-25 (Security Scan Execution Layer)

### Added

- `runtime/security_scanner.py` — `aizee security scan <path>`: built-in
  OWASP-2025-mapped rules (secrets, injection sinks, misconfig, exception
  handling, TLS, XSS surface, open redirects) + orchestration of external
  scanners when installed (bandit, `ruff --select S`, pip-audit, npm audit,
  composer audit, trivy). Exit 1 on blockers; `--json` for CI; `--no-tools`
  for offline; dedupe by (rule, file, line); example-value allowlist;
  test/fixture/vendor/generated trees skipped by default.
- `aizee security scan` wired into `.github/workflows/security.yml` as a CI
  gate (JSON report artifact; non-zero exit on blockers).
- `.env` variants (`.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.example`) now
  scanned — extension-based matching missed dotfile suffixes.
- Inline suppression markers: `# aizee-scan: ignore [RULE]` per line and
  `aizee-scan: ignore-file` per file (first 4 KiB); suppressed count reported
  separately for auditability.
- Gitignore awareness: `.env` findings downgrade blocker→low when
  `git check-ignore` confirms the file is ignored; presence-finding honors
  ignore-file markers.
- SEC-ENVFILE requires a non-empty value (empty `.env.example` placeholders
  no longer flag); TLS-WEAK-HASH honors `usedforsecurity=False`;
  generated `sbom.json` skipped.

### Fixed

- `memory/ingest.py::_validate` was stricter than
  `scripts/validate-globals.py::check_struct` — 27 valid tech-stack refs
  (DATA/API instead of RULES) were silently skipped from memory ingest.
- `test_audit_gaps::test_stored_key_reused` xdist flake — cleared
  `_audit_key_cache` before first read to close a stale-cache window.
- Pre-existing coverage gaps closed to 100%: `skill_validator`,
  `runtime/task_contract/*`, `c4_docs`, `eval/harness_exporter`,
  `aizee_mcp.tools.task_tools`, `memory/observations`.
- `guard_invariants` manifest-drift check was fail-open (`except Exception:
  pass` swallowed generator failures) — now fails closed (ImportError skips,
  other errors report a violation).
- `dashboard/app.js`: unescaped template interpolations (`${section}`,
  `${item.label}`, `${item.shortcut}`, `${w}`) now escapeHtml'd — real XSS
  hardening for registry-rendered data.
- `observations.py` SQL no longer concatenates at call site; `md5` calls in
  `simhash`/`loop_detector` marked `usedforsecurity=False`.
- Self-scan: 97 findings → **0** (45 reviewed suppressions on intentional
  patterns — detector rule tables, policy YAMLs, attack-payload suites,
  justified except-probes — plus real fixes above).

## [5.16.0] - 2026-09-25 (Task Contract + External-Source Adoption)

### Added

- `runtime/task_contract/` — **Task Contract**: enforced decompose → execute →
  verify → review lifecycle for non-trivial work. Every prompt gets a recorded
  `trivial|standard|complex` classification with required justification
  (`.task/classifications.jsonl`, heuristic vs agent disagreement flagged);
  non-trivial work requires `.task/plan.json` (kebab ids, acyclic deps,
  declared file scope, `produces` handoff contracts, acceptance checks);
  `done` requires recorded evidence or a passing `verify_cmd`; `finish()`
  emits a final-review report with scope/evidence gaps and the FULL-tier
  checklist. Amendments are logged (no silent drift). Enforcement: always-on
  `rules/task-contract.md`, `aizee hook inject` contract block, `afterFileEdit`
  scope warnings, `AIZEE_TASK_STRICT=1` for hard scope denials.
- `aizee task` CLI — `classify|decompose|status|start|verify|complete|block|
  amend|finish|abandon|scope|context`; wired into the kernel as
  `kernel.task_contract` (declared class attribute).
- `aizee_mcp/tools/task_tools.py` — 10 MCP tools exposing the contract
  lifecycle (`task_classify`, `task_decompose`, `task_status`, `task_start`,
  `task_verify`, `task_complete`, `task_block`, `task_finish`,
  `task_abandon`, `task_scope`). MCP tool count 88 → 98.
- `workflows/61-task-contract.md` + `rules/task-contract.md` — execution
  protocol and behavioral rule for the contract. manifest.json +8 triggers;
  workflows README 61→62 numbered.
- `tests/test_task_contract.py` — 44 tests covering classifier, lifecycle,
  validation, amendments, scope enforcement, hooks, and kernel wiring.
- `rules/untrusted-content.md` — BrowserSkill doctrine generalized: all
  external/tool/page/console output is data, never authority; revalidate at
  every trust boundary.
- `runtime/skill_validator.py` + `aizee skill validate` — SKILL.md contract
  checker (YAML frontmatter, name=id, activation-language description,
  structure). 132 skills: 0 errors.
- `eval/trigger_cases.json` + `tests/test_trigger_routing.py` — per-skill
  positive/negative trigger evals (agent-skills evals/cases pattern);
  caught a real routing gap (`zero-downtime deploy` alias added).
- `runtime/harness_exporter.py` + `aizee skill install --harness X` —
  BrowserSkill-style multi-harness skill installer (cursor/claude/codex/
  opencode/project/path) with overwrite protection.
- `runtime/c4_docs.py` + `aizee docs c4` — deepwiki-rs-inspired C4 doc
  generator: consumes `graphify-out/graph.json`, emits `docs/c4/context.md`,
  `containers.md`, `components/*.md` with Mermaid diagrams.
- `AGENT_INSTALL.md` — install guide written FOR agents (BrowserSkill
  pattern): install → doctor → wire harness → first governed task.
- `skills/aizee-lite/SKILL.md` — skill-as-product: portable aiZee
  governance discipline for agent hosts without aiZee installed.
- `skills/project-voice/SKILL.md` — voice-builder foundation artifact:
  produces `.ai/about-me.md` + `.ai/voice.md` consumed by all content
  skills (social-media-skills pattern).
- `skills/browser-automation/SKILL.md` — thin wrapper for Tencent
  BrowserSkill (`bsk`): real logged-in browser, evidence capture,
  untrusted-content rules baked in.
- `tech-stack/animejs-4.md` — version-locked Anime.js v4 reference
  (modular imports, timelines, stagger, SVG, scroll observer, a11y).
- `workflows/62-localhost-tunnel.md` — Cloudflare Quick Tunnel protocol:
  `cloudflared tunnel --url`, JSON stdout contract, safety policy
  (never tunnel unauthenticated ports), ephemeral cleanup.
- `skills/prompt-engineer.md` — prompt-master v1.8 delta: 9-dimension
  intent extraction, model-recency gate, risky-technique allowlist,
  token-efficiency audit, max-3-questions discipline.
- `tests/test_harness_exporter.py` + `tests/test_c4_docs.py` — FAST-tier
  coverage for the two new runtime modules.
- `skills/design-research/` — evidence-based design research doctrine
  (Refero SKILL.md + Mobbin agent docs): tool-selection matrix
  (styles/screens/flows/sections), research-before-design mandate,
  one-dominant-direction synthesis (no averaging), evidence≠proof and
  provenance rules, brief + reference-lock + post-build validation workflow.
  Cross-linked from `design-md-lord`.
- `mobbin` MCP server registered in `.devin/mcp_config.json`
  (`https://api.mobbin.com/mcp`, OAuth on first connect, Pro plan+);
  `install.ps1` alwaysAllow extended with all refero/mobbin read-only tools.
  manifest.json +8 triggers; eval trigger cases +3 positive +1 negative.
- `workflows/60-atomic-release-deployment.md` — canonical atomic release
  deployment reference (releases/ + `current` symlink + shared/) covering
  VPS, shared+SSH, and FTP-only/cPanel tiers; `mv -T` atomic swap,
  expand/contract migrations, rollback, failure-mode table, security
  checklist, and Deployer/POSIX/GitHub-Actions templates. `04-deployment.md`
  cross-references it; manifest.json + workflows README updated.

## [5.15.0] - 2026-09-18 (Observation Memory + Hooks + External Ecosystem)

### Added

- `memory/observations.py` — continuous capture -> compress -> inject loop
  (architectural pattern adapted from claude-mem): IDE lifecycle hooks feed
  tool events into a crash-safe pending queue; events are deduplicated and
  stored as compact observations in `state/observations.db`; at prompt time a
  small markdown block of recent observations is injected as context.
  Failed processing leaves pending events queued for retry — never loses data.
- `aizee hook <inject|observe|summary>` — IDE lifecycle hook entry point.
  Reads event JSON on stdin, always exits 0 (never blocks the editor).
  `.cursor/hooks.json` wires it to `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `afterFileEdit`,
  `afterShellExecution`, `afterMCPExecution`, and `stop`.
- `DesignLibrary.import_brand(name, source, overwrite=)` — import external
  `DESIGN.md` references (e.g. Refero exports) from a file path or raw
  markdown into `design-library/<brand>/DESIGN.md`. Name confinement blocks
  path traversal; content validated for markdown structure and size; cache
  invalidated on overwrite.
- `skills/skill-finder` — discover/vet external skills from the skills.sh
  registry (`npx skills find`), with supply-chain checks and explicit user
  approval before install (adapted from `vercel-labs/skills` `find-skills`).
- `skills/web-security-checklist` — implementation-level web vuln checks
  (SSRF bypass variants, upload magic bytes, XXE, JWT, mass assignment,
  GraphQL, validation/encoding). Adapted from VibeSec-Skill (Apache-2.0);
  complements `security-auditor`'s agent-layer focus.
- `skills/design-md-lord` — DESIGN.md-driven UI workflow: pick/import/apply
  real-world references via `DesignLibrary` + Refero MCP.
- `refero` MCP server registered in `.devin/mcp_config.json`
  (`https://api.refero.design/mcp`, OAuth/Bearer) for semantic style search.

### Tooling / Tests

- 50 new tests (`memory/tests/test_observations.py`, `tests/test_cli_hook.py`,
  `tests/test_design_library.py` import suite). Coverage remains 100%.

### Changed

- Release pipeline: dropped the PyPI publish job. The wheel only carries
  Python packages (`runtime`, `memory`, `aizee_mcp`, `plugins`, `eval`) —
  not the content tree (`skills/`, `rules/`, `workflows/`, `tech-stack/`),
  so `pip install aizee` would have shipped a hollow CLI. Distribution
  stays via git clone, GitHub Release, and the Docker GHCR image (which
  copies the full tree). PyPI can return later with a proper bootstrap.

## [5.14.2] - 2026-09-17 (100% Coverage Milestone + Audit Fix Batch)

### Fixed

- `runtime/spec/engine.py`: `_SpecValidator.validate_deltas` now rejects
  deltas with an unknown `delta_type` — previously they passed validation
  and were silently counted as applied without touching requirements.
- `runtime/reasoning_graph.py`: `_longest_path` gained a visited set —
  an activated root reaching an activated cycle no longer crashes with
  `RecursionError`.
- `runtime/migrations.py`: `peek_version` catches `sqlite3.Error` (not only
  `OperationalError`) — a corrupt DB file now returns 0 instead of raising
  `DatabaseError`.
- `runtime/mcp_firewall.py`: dict-spread arguments `{"a": 1, **d}` no longer
  silently drop the spread entries during policy evaluation.
- `runtime/supply_chain_guard.py`: `_parse_pyproject_deps` no longer
  collects Poetry version strings (e.g. `requests = "^2.0"`) as dependency
  names.
- `aizee_mcp/tools/context_tools.py`: `search_skills` no longer skips
  folder skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) via the stem=="skill" filter;
  `get_changelog("unreleased")` no longer returns the file preamble when
  no `[Unreleased]` section exists.
- `eval/vibe.py`: `_grade_refuse` honors constructor-supplied refuse
  patterns (was reading the class attribute, ignoring customization).

### Tooling / Tests

- **Coverage raised to 100%** (line + branch) across `runtime`, `memory`,
  `aizee_mcp`, `dashboard`, `eval` — 7,456 tests; every residual gap either
  covered by a focused test or marked `# pragma: no cover`/`no branch` with
  an in-code justification (dead defensive guards, TOCTOU races, Protocol
  stubs, POSIX-only paths on Windows).
- `fail_under` raised 68 → 100 in `pyproject.toml`, `aizee test --full`, and
  CI workflows so coverage regressions fail the suite (`eval/harness.py` keeps
  its filtered-run floor).
- `scripts/update_aizee.bat` now also syncs root `conftest.py`.
- ~40 new gap-coverage test files under `runtime/tests/`, `memory/tests/`,
  `aizee_mcp/tests/`, `eval/tests/`, `tests/`.

## [5.14.1] - 2026-09-17 (Full-Project Audit & Fix Batch)

### Fixed

- `runtime/audit.py`: hash-chain verification no longer breaks when the tail
  entry exceeds the 8 KB scan window (blank lines, missing trailing newline,
  and multibyte entries covered by regression tests).
- `memory/git_memory.py`: `commit()` returns `False` on empty/non-JSON-only
  changes instead of crashing on `git add -- "*.json"` pathspec failure;
  restores `RuntimeError` on non-repo (fail-loud); `diff()` accepts `HEAD~N`/
  `HEAD^N` revisions.
- `aizee_mcp/tools/seo_tools.py`: crawl RSS guard measures growth from a
  per-crawl baseline instead of absolute process RSS — long-running MCP
  servers (or coverage-instrumented processes) no longer abort small crawls.
- `runtime/uninstaller.py` + `uninstaller_gui.py`: added `is_aizee_root()`
  marker check — refuses to delete `runtime/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `plugins/`,
  `eval/` under a root that isn't an aiZee install.
- `runtime/__init__.py`: added 17 missing v5.14 exports to `__all__`
  (241 total); `scripts/generate_manifest.py` now understands plain
  `import X as Y` statements.
- `scripts/sync_docs.py`: AST-based, parametrization-aware test counting —
  no more `pytest --collect-only` subprocess timeout on Windows.
- `aizee_mcp/_compat.py`: `FastMCP` binds the real class under
  `TYPE_CHECKING` so it stays valid in type expressions; `Resource`/
  `FunctionResource` keep permissive `Any` aliases for duck-typed access.

### Tooling / Tests / Docs

- New `pyrightconfig.json` points Pyright at the project interpreter
  (fixes false unresolved-import diagnostics for `pytest`, `psutil`).
- `tests/mcp/conftest.py`: `AIZEE_ROOT` is restored after every MCP test —
  removes cross-suite environment pollution (flaky persona failures).
- `tests/mcp/*`: `mcp` marker now actually applied (was registered but unused);
  10 stale tests updated to intentional contracts (simhash empty string,
  secret-filter narrowing, ABResult dataclass, migrations RuntimeError, ...).
- `tests/dashboard/test_dashboard.py`: main-block test uses a valid port and
  stubs `_BoundedThreadingHTTPServer` so `serve_forever` is observed.
- Docs synced to reality: 131 runtime modules, 127 skills, 88 MCP tools,
  3888 tests; coverage gate/badge aligned to measured 68% floor;
  `.aizee-version` rewritten without UTF-8 BOM.
- `scripts/update_aizee.bat`: also syncs `spec.md`, `integrity.manifest`,
  and `pyrightconfig.json` to the deployment copy.

## [5.14.0] - 2026-09-11 (Laravel/Filament/UI Stack Mastery)

### New Runtime Modules (5)

**Laravel/Filament/UI Governance (5 modules)**
- `laravel_policy_linter.py`: 8 checks (LP001-LP008) for Laravel policy/security — $guarded=[], raw SQL, missing FormRequest, bypassed gates, missing policy methods, Filament resource without Shield, Auth::check() bypass, missing $fillable.
- `filament_access_auditor.py`: 8 checks (FA001-FA008) for Filament v5 RBAC — panel without auth middleware, resource without policy, ->can('*') wildcard, table without per-record auth, isAccessible()=true, navigation without visibility, missing Shield.
- `db_migration_safety.py`: 10 checks (MG001-MG010) for migration safety — destructive operations, missing down(), non-concurrent indexes, Model::all(), raw UPDATE, renameColumn, change column type, DB::raw, missing return types.
- `ui_a11y_checker.py`: 10 checks (A11y-001 to A11y-010) for WCAG 2.2 AA — missing alt, button without text, input without label, missing focus-visible, animations without motion-reduce, inline color, Arabic without dir="rtl", table without caption, onclick without keyboard, tabindex>0.
- `blade_template_linter.py`: 10 checks (BL001-BL010) for Blade templates — unescaped output, missing CSRF, hardcoded URLs, missing @stack, missing @error, Filament override without $view, @auth without @can, data to JS without @json.

- 5 new type-annotated attributes on `Kernel` class.
- `Kernel.status()` includes all 5 new services.

### Version Bump

- `5.13.0` → `5.14.0` in: `pyproject.toml`, `config.py`, `manifest.json`, `tests/test_config.py`, `scripts/validate-globals.py`.

## [5.13.0] - 2026-09-11 (Deep Governance Modernization)

### New Runtime Modules (17)

**MCP Security (3 modules)**
- `mcp_auditor.py`: 14 deterministic detectors (UNPINNED_PACKAGE, REMOTE_SCRIPT, WRITABLE_PATH, NON_HTTPS_URL, PLAINTEXT_SECRET, OVERBROAD_ROOT, CREDENTIAL_DIR, APPROVAL_BYPASS, IMPERATIVE_INJECTION, HIDDEN_CONTENT, INVISIBLE_UNICODE, CROSS_SERVER_REF, NAME_COLLISION, RUGPULL). Stdlib-only, no API keys or network access in scan path.
- `mcp_manifest_lock.py`: SHA-256 fingerprinting for MCP server manifests. Detects rug-pulls by diffing command, args, and tool descriptions against a locked baseline.
- `cross_tool_taint.py`: Cross-tool provenance tracking with toxic flow detection. Classifies tool results (untrusted/sensitive/normal), draws provenance edges via token matching (including base64/hex decoding), and blocks the untrusted→sensitive→egress path.

**Budget Enforcement (1 module)**
- `budget_advanced.py`: Progressive throttling (ADVISORY/THROTTLE/RESTRICT/HARD_STOP tiers), reserve/settle/release protocol (prevents double-spend), burn-rate forecaster, spend anomaly detector (z-score), model cost optimizer (34 models), shadow mode tracker (non-enforcing).

## [5.10.1] - 2026-08-31 (Security Hardening + Architecture Cleanup + Docs Sync)

### Security
- **SSRF protection (A2A adapters):** `_is_private_or_reserved_ip()` + `_is_loopback_ip()` now use `ipaddress` module for full IPv4+IPv6 coverage (fc00::/7, fe80::/10, ::1, 127/8, 169.254/16, CGNAT, multicast). DNS resolution re-check blocks hostnames resolving to private IPs. `_validate_endpoint()` extracted as reusable helper. `launch()` now uses `_a2a_open()` for redirect confinement (was plain `urlopen`).
- **RBAC fail-closed:** `AIZEE_RBAC_STRICT=1` denies admin-required tools when no roles are set; non-admin tools stay allowed (was denying all tools — logic bug fix).
- **Audit fail-closed:** `AIZEE_AUDIT_STRICT` defaults to `"1"` (raise on write failure); `=0` for fail-open. Docstring updated.
- **MCP client env allowlist:** `_build_spawn_env()` now uses default allowlist (essential system vars + AIZEE_* + common API key prefixes). `AIZEE_MCP_ENV_PASSTHROUGH=1` for full inherit (dev only). Prevents secret leakage to spawned MCP servers.
- **Supply chain:** all GitHub Actions pinned by 40-char SHA across `release.yml`, `security.yml`, `supply-chain.yml`, `validate.yml`. pip-audit (2.7.0), bandit (1.7.10), build (1.2.2.post1), twine (6.0.1) version-pinned. `|| true` removed from validate.yml pip-audit.

### Architecture
- **CompiledPipeline deleted:** orphaned class removed from `runtime/middleware.py`, `runtime/__init__.py`, and tests. Only Pattern 4 (flat array + iterative closure) remains.
- **Kernel/KernelBuilder exports:** added to `runtime/__init__.py` `__all__`.
- **KernelBuilder.with_probity():** added; `build()` syncs probity to kernel facade + policy_mgr.
- **Kernel middleware:** `_act_via_middleware()` now preserves full denial payload (reason, gate, decision, detail) instead of dropping it.
- **JsonFileStorage:** uses `RLock` (was `Lock`); `flush()` does atomic temp-file + `os.replace()`.
- **_BoundedThreadingHTTPServer:** dashboard thread pool bounded by `Semaphore`.

### Performance
- **telemetry `summary()`:** tail-read with `deque(maxlen=max_lines)` (was full-file read).
- **metrics `_quantile()`:** accepts optional pre-sorted `sorted_values`; `_samples()` sorts once.
- **learning_loop:** batch persist with `_dirty`/`_persist_counter` (threshold=100); `flush()` method added.

### QA / Tests
- **Coverage:** `fail_under` raised from 80% → 95% across `pyproject.toml`, `aizee_cli.py`, `eval/harness.py`, `release.yml`, `validate.yml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `workflows/testing-standards.md`.
- **New test package:** `aizee_mcp/tests/` with `test_mcp_command_validation.py` (shell metachar + allowlist + injection tests).
- **packaging exclude + mypy overrides:** `aizee_mcp.tests*` and `eval.tests*` added.
- **psutil:** moved from `[dev]` to main `dependencies`.
- **Test count:** 3865 tests (was 3561).

### Docs
- **Counts synced:** 109 modules / 110 skills / 54 workflows / 197 tech-stack / 3865 tests across AGENTS.md, README.md, README-AR.md, spec.md, global-workflow.md.
- **Stale 80% coverage references:** fixed in CONTRIBUTING.md, testing-standards.md.
- **Garbled tree characters:** fixed in AGENTS.md package-layout block.
- **Broken BEL char (0x07):** fixed in `.windsurfrules`.
- **global-roles.md:** 29 personas (7 added: MARKETING, GROWTH, BRAND, EMAIL, SOCIAL, CRO, SALES).
- **scripts/update_aizee.bat:** sync list expanded (rules/, .devin/, .github/, installer/, root files).

## [5.10.0] - 2026-08-30 (Dashboard Settings Panel + Schema Migration Framework)

### Dashboard Settings Panel (new UI tab)
- **New "Settings" tab** in the aiZee dashboard with 6 sub-sections:
  - **MCP Servers** — toggle 34 MCP servers on/off, grouped by 9 categories (Core/Freelance/Marketing/Social/Ads/Analytics/CRM/Billing/Other). Bulk group toggle + search filter.
  - **Budget & Costs** — max_tokens, max_cost_usd, max_calls, period, on_exceed, finalization_reserve, token weights, fallback_model (global + session scopes).
  - **Security & Gates** — Guardian (default_decision, kill_switch), MCP Firewall (catch_all_action), Policy (default_action), Loop Detector (window, threshold).
  - **Injection Defense** — 7 defense module toggles + block/suspicious thresholds.
  - **Plugins & Persona** — plugin enable/disable + default persona + multi-persona + autoload lords.
  - **Dashboard & System** — rate_limit, rate_window, max_body_size, bind_host + telemetry + audit retention + memory decay/vector + design tooling + **Restart aiZee** button.
- **6 new API endpoints** in `dashboard/server.py`:
  - `GET /api/settings` — return all or one section (`?section=`).
  - `POST /api/settings` — save a section (`{section, data}`).
  - `GET /api/settings/defaults` — return defaults for a section or all.
  - `POST /api/settings/reset` — reset a section to defaults.
  - `GET /api/settings/mcp-status` — MCP server status + categories.
  - `POST /api/settings/restart` — soft-reload kernel (reset caches + terminate MCP pool + reload settings).
- **Toggle switches, toast notifications, light-theme support, responsive layout** in `dashboard/index.css` (200 lines).
- **570 lines of JS** in `dashboard/app.js` — 6 render functions + collectSettingsData + save/reset/restart + toast + search filter.

### Settings Manager (`runtime/settings.py` — new module)
- **`SettingsManager`** — thread-safe, fail-safe settings persistence to `state/settings.json` (separate from canonical config sources).
- **14 sections**: mcp_servers, budget, guardian, mcp_firewall, policy, loop_detector, injection_defense, plugins, persona, dashboard, telemetry, audit, memory, design.
- **Validation** on save — period, on_exceed, decisions, reserve range, positive integers, booleans.
- **Fail-safe** — missing/corrupt file → defaults (never crash). Corrupt files quarantined to `settings.json.corrupt.bak`.
- **Atomic writes** — `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace` (no partial writes on crash).
- **Deep merge** — partial updates (e.g. toggling one MCP server) don't wipe the rest.

### Schema Migration Framework
- **`SETTINGS_VERSION = 2`** + `_MIGRATIONS` registry + `_register_migration()` decorator.
- **Automatic migration on load** — `_migrate_if_needed()` backs up old file to `settings.json.v{old}.bak`, runs sequential migration steps, bumps version, saves migrated data.
- **Orphaned key pruning** — keys not in `SECTIONS` are removed on load (clean upgrade path).
- **`migrate()` public method** — called by `scripts/update.py` in post-install hooks (step 5).
- **v1 → v2 migration** — ensures `dashboard.trusted_proxies` exists, removes orphaned keys.

### Update Script (`scripts/update.py`)
- **Step 5 added** to post-install hooks: `SettingsManager.migrate()` — runs settings migration after `git pull`.
- Fresh install (no `settings.json`) → "no settings.json (fresh install)".
- Existing file → backup + migrate + merge.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_settings_manager.py`** — 39 tests covering defaults, load/save, validation, section updates, MCP toggles, reset, fail-safe on corrupt file, **migration** (v1→v2, orphan cleanup, backup creation, user value preservation).
- **`tests/dashboard/test_dashboard.py`** — fixed 2 pre-existing version mismatch failures (hardcoded `"5.7.1"` → `config.VERSION`).

### Quality Gates
- ruff check: PASS (4 Python files).
- mypy --strict: PASS (3 Python files).
- pytest: 39/39 settings tests + 84/84 dashboard tests = 123 passed.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-08-29 (Marketing/Freelance MCP Integration + Runtime Wiring + Plugin Hardening)

### Runtime Module Wiring (12 modules → 10 MCP tools)
- **analytics_tools.py** — wired `attribution_model`, `funnel_tracker`, `lead_scorer`, `marketing_compliance`, `pipeline_analytics`. New tools: `lead_score`, `compliance_check`, `pipeline_win_rate`, `funnel_dropoff`.

- **_ENV_ALLOWLIST** — `runtime/mcp_client.py` expanded with 27 plugins' env vars (33 new entries).

### Runtime Bug Fixes
- **post_queue.py** — fixed `field(default_factory=list)` → `[]` (broken queue init).
- **pipeline_analytics.py** — `_Bid.won` changed from `bool` to `bool | None`; `win_rate` now excludes pending bids; `ValueError`/`TypeError` → `ValidationError`.
- **experiment_tracker.py** — added validation for conversions > visitors; `NotImplementedError` → `ValidationError`.
- **drip_engine.py** — `ready_steps` now accepts `context: dict | None = None` parameter.
- **marketing_compliance.py** — `ValueError` → `ValidationError`.
- **crm_manager.py** — moved `ValidationError` import to top-level.

- **PluginRegistry** (`runtime/plugin_system.py`) — Plugin discovery, manifest validation, lifecycle management (DISCOVERED→ACTIVE→ERROR→DISABLED), keyword + persona indexing, hook execution (UserPromptSubmit/PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop). 14 tests.
- **DesignLibrary** (`runtime/design_library.py`) — 56 brand design systems catalog (Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Figma...). Load single brand, mix 2-3 brands (simple or granular section mapping), auto-detect project type and suggest best-fit brands. 12 tests.

### Persona System Enhancements
- **Reset Shortcuts (17 triggers):** `/reset`, `#reset`, `/انتحل`, `#شخصيات`, `/بدّل`, `/persona`, `#switch`, etc. in `runtime/persona.py`. When detected, `inject_persona_context` clears existing persona fields and re-detects based on hint text. 15 tests.
- **Status Shortcuts (17 triggers):** `/status`, `#status`, `/حالة`, `#مين`, `/whoami`, `/info`, etc. When detected, populates `context["persona_status"]` with formatted Arabic report (persona name, weight, skills with descriptions, lords with descriptions). 18 tests.
- **personas.yaml:** 8 new lord_skills entries with keyword indexes. UX persona gets 6 design skills, DEV gets backend-design, QA gets qa-automation.

### Kernel Integration
- `kernel.py::_init_core_services` now initializes `design_slop_verifier`, `design_library`, `plugin_registry`.
- `runtime/__init__.py` exports 20+ new symbols.

### Prompt Injection Defense Stack (from earlier in session)
- 7 modules: `injection_detector`, `defensive_injection`, `tool_output_sanitizer`, `prompt_injection_detector`, `dual_llm`, `agent_baseline`, `prompt_injection_suite`.
- 13-technique deterministic scanner + active counter-injection + indirect-injection defense + dual-LLM isolation + behavioral anomaly detection.
- 82 tests across 7 test files.

### Research Reports (2)
- `tech-stack/claude-code-skills-research.md` — Comprehensive study of 50+ Claude Code skills across 6 domains.

## [5.7.1] - 2026-08-24 (Comprehensive Review: 17 Fixes Across 125 Files)

### Critical Fixes (3)
- **k8s NetworkPolicy egress** (`deploy/k8s/deployment.yaml`): `to: []` blocked ALL outbound traffic. Fixed to allow HTTPS egress to any destination.
- **schema_contract missing memory_decay** (`memory/schema_contract.py`): `memory_decay` table created in `store.py` but missing from `default_memory_contract()` → schema drift warnings on every init. Added table + index to contract.
- **mcp_firewall.yaml default_action silently ignored** (`runtime/policies/mcp_firewall.yaml`): GATE-B3 restriction caused `default_action: allow` to be silently dropped → MCP tools became `ask` instead of `allow`. Fixed by removing `default_action` and adding catch-all allow rule with priority 0. Also fixed YAML parsing error (unquoted colon in description).

### High Priority Fixes (3)
- **Missing runtime exports** (`runtime/__init__.py`): 12 new module exports missing (ConfidenceGate, LearningLoop, SkillRouter, Bounder, Witness, LazyImport, ReflexionLog, OutputEnvelope, CostProvider, etc.). Added all exports + `__all__` entries.
- **Probity normalization inconsistency** (`runtime/probity.py`): `EnforceFilenameCasing` and `EnforceTdd` checked `("write", "edit")` directly instead of using `normalize_action_type()`. Fixed to use consistent normalization.
- **Constitution regex too narrow** (`runtime/spec/engine.py`): `r"MUST\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)"` missed principles ending with `!`, `?`, `;`, `:`, or newlines. Fixed to `r"MUST\s+(.+?)(?:[.!?;:]|\n|$)"`.

### Medium Priority Fixes (5)
- **delete_by_source_batch length validation** (`memory/store.py`): No length limit on source strings. Added 1000-char max validation.
- **ConfidenceGate weight validation** (`runtime/confidence_gate.py`): No validation that weights are in [0.0, 1.0]. Added validation with ValueError on out-of-range.
- **LazyImport error handling** (`runtime/quality.py`): Malformed import paths raised cryptic errors. Added path validation + try/except with clear error messages.
- **Priority parsing error handling** (`runtime/policy.py`): `int(r.get("priority", 0))` crashed on non-numeric strings. Added `_safe_priority()` helper with try/except + warning.
- **FTS5 sanitization enhanced** (`memory/store.py`): Parentheses and hyphens not stripped from FTS5 queries. Added to sanitization regex.

### Policy Files Cleanup (6 files)
- Removed `default_action` from 5 non-default policy files (agentic-owasp.yaml, consequence-tiers.yaml, mcp_firewall.yaml, examples/api-rate-limits.yaml, examples/data-exfiltration.yaml, examples/time-based-access.yaml). Only default.yaml now sets default_action per GATE-B3.

### New Tests (17)
- Weight validation tests (5) in test_confidence_gate.py
- LazyImport error handling tests (3) in test_quality.py
- Priority parsing tests (6) in test_policy.py
- delete_by_source_batch validation tests (4) in test_memory_upgrades.py

## [5.7.0] — 2026-08-24 (Implementation Plan Remediation: 8 Workstreams, 40+ Items)

### WS-C: Dead Code Removal
- Removed 26 dead runtime modules + their test files
- Updated manifest.json, README.md, README-AR.md, AGENTS.md, spec.md, tech-stack/aizee-5.md
- Runtime module count: 105 → 81

### WS-B: Gate-Contract Repairs
- **GATE-B1**: Structured denial for probity violations (catch `GuardrailViolationError` → structured dict)
- **GATE-B2**: `normalize_action_type()` maps Bash/Shell/Command → exec, Apply/Patch → write
- **GATE-B3**: Audit (rule names in denial), `_MISSING` sentinel prevents None==None escalation, policy `priority` field + sorting, `default_action` writable only by default.yaml
- **GATE-B4**: Deprecated bypass paths `register_action_pipeline()` / `_get_compiled_pipeline()`

### WS-A: Security Hardening
- **SEC-W1**: Dashboard loopback enforcement (`AGENT_OS_HOST`, `_is_loopback_host()`)
- **SEC-W2**: K8s deploy manifests (NetworkPolicy ingress/egress restrictions, README)
- **SEC-W3**: Dashboard robustness (Content-Length parsing, `?limit=` on audit/tracing, SSE headers + max duration)

### WS-D: Eval Overhaul
- **EVAL-W0**: `GateVerdict` unified dataclass + `to_gate_verdict()` adapters (prompt_gate, mcp_firewall, agent_gateway)
- **EVAL-W1**: `eval/pipeline.py` — real kernel.act() pipeline (no vibe checks)
- **EVAL-W2**: 10 executable assertion kinds (eq, contains, not_contains, regex, key_exists, ok_true, ok_false, decision_is, gate_is, custom)
- **EVAL-W3**: `AnchoredDimension` rubric anchored to executable assertions
- **EVAL-W5**: `eval/redteam.py` — red-team runner + SARIF 2.1.0 reporter
- **EVAL-W6**: Per-gate + per-policy breakdown in pipeline results

### WS-E: SDD Enforcement
- **W1**: Task verification (evidence + `verified` flag blocks phase advance)
- **W2**: Constitution enforcement (MUST principles checked against requirements)
- **W3**: State transition history (audit trail in `state_history`)
- **W4**: Drift v2 (file modifications + unapplied deltas + phase regressions)
- **W5**: Paginated spec listing (`list_specs_paginated`)
- **W6**: Delta hardening (validate references, duplicates, empty descriptions)

### WS-F: Memory Upgrades
- **W1**: Deterministic IDs (content hash → stable `mem_XXXX` IDs)
- **W2**: Deduplication (same content → same ID → no-op on re-add)
- **W3**: Fact extraction (heuristic verb-based sentence extraction)
- **W4**: Temporal search (`search_temporal` by valid_from range)
- **W5**: Decay persistence (`memory_decay` table, `record_access`/`apply_decay`/`get_decay_score`)
- **W6**: Search hardening (`search_safe` with length/null-byte/SQL-keyword sanitization)

### WS-H: Confidence Gating
- `runtime/confidence_gate.py` — `ConfidenceGate` with weighted evidence, `ConfidenceVerdict` (frozen), 4 confidence levels, fail-closed

### WS-G: Learning Loop
- `runtime/learning_loop.py` — LEARN-01 hook bindings (auto-record via POST_RESPONSE + ON_ERROR); LEARN-02 record-consolidate-rank-inject with persistence

### WS-I: Skills/Personas
- `runtime/skill_routing.py` — SKILL-W1 `SkillRouter` routing meta-prompt; SKILL-W2 `PersonaDetectorV2` with confidence + ambiguity detection

### WS-J: Misc Quality
- `runtime/quality.py` — W1 `CostProvider`/`FixedRateCostProvider`; W3 assertion helpers; W5 `OutputEnvelope`; W6 `Bounder`; W7 `Witness`/`WitnessRecorder`; W8 `LazyImport`; W9 `ReflexionLog`

### Quality Gates
- ruff: PASS (repo-wide, 0 errors)
- mypy: PASS (240 source files, 0 errors)
- pytest: Full suite green (1 skip for tkinter display)
- 200+ new tests across 11 new test files

## [5.6.0] — 2026-08-23 (Security Hardening + Quality Gates Zeroed + Docs Sync Automation)

### Critical Security Fixes (3)
- **Policy evaluator privilege-escalation** (`runtime/policy.py`): YAML-style `true`/`false`/`null` literals in conditions were parsed as variable names. `flag == true` matched every action MISSING that flag (`None == None → True`). `reversible == true → allow` auto-approved all write/edit/apply regardless of reversibility. Fixed via `_yaml_literals` mapping + fail-closed TypeError handling. 13 regression tests (`test_policy_evaluator_security.py`).
- **Guardian fail-closed** (`runtime/managers/policy_manager.py`): broken `guardian.authorize` now denies with `guardian_error` + audit log instead of silently allowing.
- **approve-via-GET removed** (`dashboard/server.py`): GET `/api/check` is dry-run only; `?approve=1` returns 400. Closes localhost CSRF privilege escalation.

### Security Hardening (9 more fixes)
- **verify_ssl effective** (`aizee_mcp/adapters.py`): False builds a real unverified SSL context (+ init warning); previously returned None = default verified context.
- **A2A timeouts**: launch/poll pass `request_timeout` (default 30s) + SSL context; socket timeouts mark sessions failed instead of hanging.
- **Stable vector ids** (`memory/vector.py`): non-UUID fallback hashes via blake2b (was salted `hash()` → orphaned vectors after restart).
- **Checkpoint thread-safety** (`memory/checkpoint.py`): RLock around shared SQLite connection.
- **Non-strict output validation hardened** (`aizee_mcp/tools/mcp_output_schemas.py`): dropped `model_construct` bypass; invalid fields dropped then re-validated.
- **git_memory path sanitization** (`memory/git_memory.py`): category/entry_id validated against safe-component regex (blocks traversal).
- **CLI error handling** (`aizee_cli.py`): friendly errors for malformed JSON args; sync/graphify report failures instead of tracebacks/silent success.
- **SEO fallback registration** (`aizee_mcp/aizee_server.py`): manual fallback now registers all 8 SEO tools.
- **Dashboard CSP**: script-src 'unsafe-inline' removed — JS moved to external `dashboard/app.js`, inline handlers replaced with addEventListener.

### Dashboard (Design Decisions)
- **Open-access by default**: tokens removed by default; auth is OPT-IN via `AIZEE_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` env only. Safety preserved by 127.0.0.1 binding + read-only GETs + CSRF custom-header on POSTs.
- **Assets served from code directory**: `/`, `/app.js`, `/index.css`, favicons resolve from server code's own directory (`_asset_dir()`) — never from discovered root. Fixes version-mismatch dead UI. Tests use `_ASSET_DIR_OVERRIDE`.
- **Cache-Control: no-cache** on all responses (prevents stale-shell breakage after upgrades).
- **Direct execution hardened**: `python dashboard/server.py` bootstraps sys.path for any CWD.

### Architecture & Refactor
- **spec_engine.py (876 lines) split** into `runtime/spec/` package: models / engine / scaffold / analysis / templates. `runtime.spec_engine` remains a backward-compatible facade.
- **Persona injection unified**: single `inject_persona_context()` in `runtime/persona.py` replaces 3 duplicated blocks (kernel/workflow_manager/workflow).
- **Read-only classification unified**: `PolicyManager._READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` derives from canonical `READ_ACTIONS` in `runtime/policy.py` (+ ChatMessage).
- **ChatManager implemented**: new `runtime/local_responder.py` answers status/budget/workflow/rules/skills/stack intents from live kernel state (zero tokens, honest offline label) instead of hardcoded "Acknowledged".

### Tooling & Docs
- **`scripts/sync_docs.py`** (new): counts + workflow routing table regenerated from filesystem truth; `--check` wired into CI validate workflow.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** added: two-tier testing, code standards, module/skill/workflow recipes.
- **pytest-timeout** wired (300s, thread method) guarding CI against hung tests.
- **True async tests added**: Guardian invoke/ainvoke decorators + A2A adapter executor path.
- **CI validate.yml**: type-check corrected to `aizee_cli.py` (was nonexistent `cli.py`); docs sync check added.
- **Counts synced**: AGENTS.md/spec.md (105 modules / 73 skills / 36 workflows / 163 stack refs); README/README-AR badges updated.

### Quality Gates → Green
- **mypy: 0 errors** across runtime/memory/aizee_mcp/config/cli/dashboard (268 files) — was 7 pre-existing.
- **ruff: 0 errors** repo-wide — was 13 pre-existing.
- **Full suite green** (~4,050 tests), coverage 96.26% (floor 80%).

### Version Bump
- 5.5.0 → 5.6.0 across: pyproject.toml, .aizee-version, manifest.json, README.md, README-AR.md, tech-stack/aizee-5.md, aizee_mcp/API.md, scripts/validate-globals.{py,ps1}, tests/dashboard/test_dashboard.py.

## [Previous] — Dashboard: Assets Served From Code Directory (Version-Coherence Fix)

- **User-reported dead UI** ("Connecting..." stuck, side menu unresponsive in every browser): running the new server while `AIZEE_ROOT` pointed at another install served OLD inline-script markup under the NEW strict CSP, silently blocking all JS. Verified via headless Chromium that matching assets work.
- **Fix**: `/`, `/app.js`, `/index.css`, favicons and logo now resolve from the server code's own directory (`_asset_dir()`), never from a discovered root — UI and server are always the same version. Tests use `_ASSET_DIR_OVERRIDE`.
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` to every response so upgraded shells are always re-fetched.

## [Previous] — Dashboard: Open-Access by Default (Tokens Now Opt-In)

- **Design decision**: dashboard authentication is no longer automatic. `state/dashboard.token` files and auto-generation are removed entirely; the only auth source is the `AIZEE_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` env var. Unset (default) = open APIs.
- Safety without a token is preserved by: 127.0.0.1 default binding, read-only/dry-run GETs (`approve` via GET already removed), and the CSRF custom-header requirement on all POSTs.
- Static UI assets (`/`, `/app.js`, icons) are served unauthenticated in both modes, fixing the chicken-and-egg deadlock where the page asking for the token was itself token-protected.
- Startup prints an "Open-access mode" notice; app.js still prompts for a token on 401 when opt-in auth is enabled.
- Direct execution hardened: `python dashboard/server.py` bootstraps sys.path so it works from any CWD.

## [Previous] — Elite Review: Policy Evaluator Privilege-Escalation Fix

### Critical Security Fix
- **`runtime/policy.py` `_SafeEvaluator`**: YAML-style `true`/`false`/`null` literals in rule conditions were parsed as variable names. `flag == true` matched every action MISSING the flag (`None == None → True`). Concretely: `reversible == true → allow` auto-approved all write/edit/apply regardless of reversibility (privilege escalation), and deny rules like `tier-consequential-git-writes` falsely denied benign actions (e.g. ChatMessage "what is the status?"). Fixed via `_yaml_literals` mapping + fail-closed TypeError handling for membership checks on missing attributes. 13 regression tests added (`test_policy_evaluator_security.py`).

### Review Findings Fixed
- **CI validate.yml** type-checked nonexistent `cli.py`; corrected to `aizee_cli.py`.
- **RemoteA2AAdapter**: SSL context memoized (was reloading the system CA store on every poll tick).
- **Dashboard `/app.js` route** now covered by a test (content-type + body).

## [Previous] — Security Hardening + Quality Gates Zeroed + Docs Sync Automation

### Security Fixes (from full project audit)
- **[CRITICAL] Dashboard auth**: `dashboard/app.js` now sends `Authorization: Bearer` on every request; 401 prompts for the token (sessionStorage). The bundled UI previously only worked in ALLOW_NO_TOKEN mode.
- **[CRITICAL] approve-via-GET removed**: GET `/api/check` is dry-run only; `?approve=1` returns 400. Closes localhost CSRF privilege escalation.
- **[CRITICAL] Guardian fail-closed**: broken `guardian.authorize` now denies with `guardian_error` + audit log instead of silently allowing.
- **verify_ssl effective** (`aizee_mcp/adapters.py`): False builds a real unverified SSL context (+ init warning); previously returned None = default verified context.
- **A2A timeouts**: launch/poll pass `request_timeout` (default 30s) + SSL context; socket timeouts mark sessions failed instead of hanging the executor thread.
- **Stable vector ids**: non-UUID fallback hashes via blake2b (was salted `hash()` → orphaned vectors after restart).
- **Checkpoint thread-safety**: RLock around shared SQLite connection in `memory/checkpoint.py`.
- **Non-strict output validation hardened**: dropped `model_construct` bypass; invalid fields dropped then re-validated.
- **git_memory path safety**: category/entry_id validated against safe-component regex (blocks traversal).
- **CLI error handling**: friendly errors for malformed JSON args (check/run/policy/saga/mcp/agent); sync/graphify report failures instead of tracebacks/silent success; doctor passes project_root to Kernel.
- **SEO fallback registration**: manual MCP fallback now registers all 8 SEO tools.
- **Dashboard CSP**: script-src 'unsafe-inline' removed — JS moved to external `/app.js`, inline handlers replaced with addEventListener bindings.
- **Windows token ACL**: dashboard token file restricted via icacls (chmod is a no-op on Windows).

### Product Bugs Fixed
- **nofollow robots directive** now flagged by `seo_audit_page` (feature was tested but never implemented).
- **`multiple-h1` rule_id** test mismatch fixed (test expected nonexistent `h1-multiple`).
- **Guardian foreign defaults removed**: Monica's BaseService permission dependencies no longer shipped in core.

### Quality Gates → Green on main
- **mypy: 0 errors** across runtime/memory/aizee_mcp/config/cli/dashboard (268 files) — was 7 pre-existing.
- **ruff: 0 errors** repo-wide — was 13 pre-existing.
- **Full suite green** (~4,050 tests), coverage 96.26% (floor 80%). Previously-failing SEO network tests were real product bugs, now fixed with mocks intact.

### Architecture & Refactor
- **spec_engine.py (876 lines) split** into `runtime/spec/` package: models / engine / scaffold / analysis / templates. `runtime.spec_engine` remains a backward-compatible facade. Phase-gate logic deduplicated (`_phase_gate`), md5 finding ids → sha256.
- **Persona injection unified**: single `inject_persona_context()` in `runtime/persona.py` replaces 3 duplicated blocks (kernel/workflow_manager/workflow).
- **Read-only classification unified**: `PolicyManager._READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` derives from canonical `READ_ACTIONS` in `runtime/policy.py` (+ ChatMessage).
- **ChatManager implemented**: new `runtime/local_responder.py` answers status/budget/workflow/rules/skills/stack intents from live kernel state (zero tokens, honest offline label) instead of hardcoded "Acknowledged".

### Tooling & Docs
- **`scripts/sync_docs.py`**: counts + workflow routing table regenerated from filesystem truth; `--check` wired into CI validate workflow. Fixed AGENTS.md/spec.md stale counts (88→105 modules, 66→73 skills, 30→36 workflows, 162→163 stack refs), README duplicate table + missing rows (27, 33-35), double-listed memory-sync row.
- **pytest-timeout wired** (300s, thread method) guarding CI against hung tests.
- **True async tests added**: Guardian invoke/ainvoke decorators + A2A adapter executor path (real event loop, timeout/context assertions).
- **Conditional assertion fixed** in `tests/mcp/test_mcp_server.py` (seeded search results must exist and carry fields).
- **CONTRIBUTING.md added** (was referenced but missing): two-tier testing, code standards, module/skill/workflow recipes.
- Removed untracked `fetch-free-keys.py` (conflicted with supply-chain posture) + cleaned references.

  - `AGENTS.md`: 36 lines, 44 repairs (box-drawing + em-dash restored)
  - `.windsurfrules`: 4 lines, 4 repairs (em-dash restored)

### High Priority Fixes
- **Documentation drift**: Corrected stale module/skill/workflow/tool counts across 6 files:
  - Runtime modules: 60+ → 87 (in AGENTS.md, spec.md, README.md, docs/ONBOARDING_SRE.md, aizee-5.md)
  - MCP tools: 27 → 35 (in AGENTS.md, spec.md, README.md, aizee-5.md, docs/ONBOARDING_SRE.md)
  - Skills: 31 → 64 (in AGENTS.md, spec.md, README.md)

- **KernelBuilder**: Fluent builder for dependency injection
- **MCP client async/sync unified**: `call_tool` delegates to `async_call_tool` via `asyncio.run()`
- **Test organization**: 10 test files moved from `tests/runtime/` to `runtime/tests/`
- **Weak assertions fixed**: `test_p3_features.py` + `test_dynamic_persona.py`
- **DB connection pooling**: `BaseRepository` pools SQLite connections (pool size 5)

### Version
- Version bumped to 5.2.0 across `pyproject.toml`, `manifest.json`, `.aizee-version`, `README.md`, `README-AR.md`, `aizee_mcp/API.md`, `validate-globals.py`, `validate-globals.ps1`.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-18 (Second Audit)

### Fixed — Critical Issues (P0)
- **`cryptography` version mismatch**: Upper bound raised `<46.0` → `<52.0` to accommodate installed 50.0.0. `pip check` no longer warns.
- **`guardian.yaml` missing**: Created `runtime/policies/guardian.yaml` with 10 rules (deny rm -rf, force push, reset --hard, DROP TABLE, eval/exec; require approval for deploy, git push, curl, pip install; deny secret exfil). Guardian gate now active from day 1. Added `regex` operator to `_PredicateEvaluator`.
- **`capabilities: []` empty**: `AgentCapabilities.__init__` now grants 5 default capabilities (read, write, exec, deploy, destructive). `kernel.status()` reports meaningful capabilities. Added `revoke()` method + `defaults=False` option for empty init.
- **`probity.yaml` missing**: Created `runtime/policies/probity.yaml` with 13 rules (block rm -rf, force push, reset --hard, dd, mkfs, chmod 777, curl|bash; block hardcoded secrets, eval, pickle, shell=True, f-string SQL; enforce kebab-case). Probity integrity layer now active.

### Changed — Python 3.14 Targets (P1)
- **`ruff target-version`**: `py310` → `py314`. Enables 3.14-specific linting.
- **`mypy python_version`**: `3.12` → `3.14`. Enables 3.14-specific type checking.
- **`pyproject.toml` classifiers**: Added `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13` and `3.14`.
- **`ruff` ignore list**: Added `UP042` (str+Enum → StrEnum, needs refactoring) and `UP046` (Generic class type params).

### Added — MemoryStore Public API (P1)
- **`MemoryStore.count()`**: Returns total memory count (public method).
- **`MemoryStore.list_all(kind=None, limit=1000)`**: Lists memories, optionally filtered by kind, most recent first.
- **`MemoryStore.delete_hard(mem_id)`**: Hard-deletes a memory (row + vector). Returns True if existed.
- **`MemoryStoreAdapter` refactored**: Now uses public API only — no more `_conn()`/`_row_to_memory()` private access.

### Added — Test Cleanup + Env Template (P1)
- **`conftest.py` autouse fixture**: `gc.collect()` after each test to close leaked SQLite connections. Reduces `ResourceWarning: unclosed database` warnings.
- **`BaseRepository.close()`**: Added no-op `close()` method for resource cleanup interface.
- **`.env.example`**: Template with all env vars (AIZEE_ROOT, AIOS_ENCRYPTION_KEY, dashboard, Sentry, Upwork, Freelancer, LinkedIn, Graphify).

### Added — CLI Commands + Dashboard (P2)
- **`aizee doctor` expanded**: 7 new checks — guardian.yaml (10 rules), probity.yaml (13 rules), capabilities (5), tech_stack detection (7 entries), cryptography version match, .env.example template. 33 total checks.
- **`aizee memory ingest --watch`**: Auto re-ingests when tech-stack/, rules/, or workflows/ files change. Polls every 2s, Ctrl+C to stop.
- **`aizee spec` CLI**: New command with `list`, `analyze`, `converge`, `scaffold` subcommands. Exposes SpecEngine from terminal (was MCP-only).
- **Plugin auto-discovery**: `PluginManager._discover_plugins()` now auto-loads all `plugins/*/` with valid `__init__.py` when `plugins.yaml` is missing or empty. Previously required explicit listing.
- **`aizee audit` CLI**: New command with `show` (filtered by type/limit) + `verify` (hash chain integrity). Added `AuditLogger.read_entries()` method.
- **Dashboard SSE stream expanded**: Now includes agents, guardian_rules, capabilities, tech_stack (was: version/budgets/metrics only).

### Quality Gate
- ruff ✅, mypy ✅ (174 source files), pytest ✅ (2544 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped tkinter, 96.42% cov), eval/harness ✅ `all_pass: true`, validate-globals ✅ 0 errors.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed — Python 3.14 Compatibility (P0)
- **`test_guardian.py`**: Replaced `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` with `asyncio.run()` (4 tests). `get_event_loop()` removed in Python 3.14.
- **`test_rate_limiter.py`**: Changed `== 7.0` to `pytest.approx(7.0, abs=0.01)` for float comparison (time drift caused flaky failure: `7.000004053115845 != 7.0`).
- **`test_spec_engine.py`**: exec globals now includes `__file__` to prevent `NameError` when module-level code references `Path(__file__)`.
- **`test_uninstaller_gui.py`**: Added `pytest.importorskip("tkinter")` to prevent collection break on headless/Python 3.14 Windows where tkinter is unavailable.

### Added — Internal Tech-Stack References (P1.1, Dogfooding)
- 7 new `tech-stack/*.md` files for aiZee's own stack: `python-3.md`, `aizee-5.md`, `pydantic-2.md`, `mcp-1.md`, `pytest-7.md`, `pytest-8.md`, `pyyaml-6.md`, `rich-13.md`.
- **`runtime/tech_stack.py`**: `_parse_pyproject_toml()` now registers the project self-name + version and extracts `requires-python` version. Added `aizee` → `aios` alias.
- **Result**: `get_os_status` MCP tool and `kernel.detect_tech_stack()` now return 7 tech_stack entries instead of empty `{}`. aiZee now satisfies `[VER-01]` for itself.

### Changed — Smart Policy Fallback (P1.2)
- **`runtime/policy.py`**: `PolicyEngine.evaluate()` now classifies unmatched actions by type instead of using blanket `default_action`:
  - Read actions (view, read, grep, search, status, etc.) → `allow`
  - Write actions (edit, write, deploy, exec, etc.) → `ask`
  - Destructive actions (rm, delete, truncate, drop, etc.) → `deny`
  - Unknown actions → `ask` (conservative)
  - YAML `default_action=deny` still wins as strict override.
- 4 new tests in `test_policy.py` for classification logic.

### Changed — asyncio 3.14 Compatibility (P1.3)
- **`aizee_mcp/adapters.py`**: `asyncio.get_event_loop()` → `asyncio.get_running_loop()` (4 occurrences in `RemoteA2AAdapter.launch/poll`). Correct API for use inside async functions.
- **`runtime/guardian.py`**: `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` → `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` (deprecated in 3.14, removed in 3.16).
- **`tests/mcp/test_adapters.py`**: Updated 9 mock patches from `asyncio.get_event_loop` to `asyncio.get_running_loop`.

### Added — StorageBackend ↔ MemoryStore Bridge (P1.4)
- **`runtime/storage_backend.py`**: New `MemoryStoreAdapter` class that wraps `MemoryStore` to implement the `StorageBackend` protocol. Enables new code using `StorageFactory` to access the rich `MemoryStore` (SQLite + FTS5 + vector) through the uniform interface. Supports `put` (dict or Memory), `get`, `delete` (soft via invalidate), `scan` (optionally filtered by kind), `keys`, `count`, `clear`, and no-op `flush`/`load`.
- 12 new tests in `test_storage_backend.py` (`TestMemoryStoreAdapter`).

### Fixed — `__file__` Robustness in `__main__` Blocks (P2.1)
- 3 runtime modules (`tree_sitter_provider.py`, `semantic_search.py`, `codegraph.py`) now guard `Path(__file__)` in `__main__` blocks with `"__file__" in globals()` fallback. Prevents `NameError` when exec'd without `__file__` in globals.
- `spec_engine.py` already fixed in P0.3 with module-level guard.

### Quality Gate
- ruff ✅, mypy ✅, pytest ✅ (2527+ passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped tkinter), tech_stack detection returns 7 entries.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-17

### Added — Architecture Patterns from spec-kit + Floci
- **Spec-driven templates** (`tech-stack/spec-driven-templates/`): 5 templates (spec, plan, tasks, constitution, checklist) adapted from GitHub spec-kit. Used by `SpecEngine.scaffold_spec/plan/tasks/checklist()`.
- **Spec cross-artifact analysis** (`SpecEngine.analyze_artifacts()`): detects coverage gaps, ambiguity (vague terms without measurable criteria), underspecification ([NEEDS CLARIFICATION]/TODO markers), and constitution violations. Read-only. Workflow `22-spec-analyze.md`.
- **Spec-to-code convergence** (`SpecEngine.converge_to_code()`): assesses codebase against spec/plan/tasks, classifies gaps as missing/partial/contradicts, suggests remediation tasks. Read-only. Workflow `23-spec-converge.md`.
- **Constitution system** (`SpecEngine.set_constitution()` + `validate_checklist()`): per-spec governing principles with MUST/SHOULD enforcement.
- **Pluggable storage backend** (`runtime/storage_backend.py`): `StorageBackend` protocol + 3 implementations (InMemoryStorage, JsonFileStorage, SqliteStorage) + `StorageFactory` with path-based caching and lifecycle management (load/flush/shutdown). Inspired by Floci's `StorageBackend<K,V>` + `StorageFactory`. 41 tests.
- **Multi-index service catalog** (`runtime/service_catalog.py`): `ServiceDescriptor` (frozen dataclass) + `ServiceCatalog` with 6 indexes (by_name, by_kind, by_persona, by_trigger, by_tech_stack, by_lord) + `match_trigger()`/`match_tech_stack()` for ranked text matching + `build_catalog_from_directory()`. Inspired by Floci's `ServiceCatalog`. 28 tests.
- **AizeeError hierarchy** (`runtime/schemas.py`): `AizeeError` base + `PolicyDeniedError`, `BudgetExceededError`, `ValidationError`, `StorageError` subclasses. Each carries `error_code`, `severity`, `context` dict. `to_dict()` for structured logging. Inspired by Floci's `AwsException`.
- **PaginatedResult** (`runtime/schemas.py`): `items` + `next_token` + `total` dataclass for paginated list operations. `to_dict()` + `has_more` property. Inspired by Floci's `PaginatedResult<T>`.
- **AGENTS.md expanded** with Floci-style sections: Architecture, Package Layout, First Principles, Adding a New Runtime Module/Skill/Workflow, Error Handling, Storage Rules, Common Mistakes, Human Handoff, Code Style, Logging, PR Guidelines.

### Branding — Renamed to aiZee
- **Project renamed**: AI Global OS → **aiZee** ("The policy layer for AI coding.").
- **Package**: `aios` → `aizee` (pip install aizee).
- **CLI**: `ai-os` → `aizee` (lowercase, no capital Z required).
- **Env vars**: `AGENT_OS_ROOT` → `AIZEE_ROOT`, `AGENT_OS_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` → `AIZEE_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`.
- **MCP server name**: `ai-global-os` → `aizee` in all agent configs.
- **Files renamed**: `aios_cli.py` → `aizee_cli.py`, `aios_mcp/` → `aizee_mcp/`, `aios_server.py` → `aizee_server.py`, `.aios-version` → `.aizee-version`, `aios_mcp_wrapper.py` → `aizee_mcp_wrapper.py`.
- **Clean break**: no backward-compat alias for `ai-os` (per user decision).

### Added — Uninstaller + K8s + Benchmarks
- **Interactive uninstaller** (`runtime/uninstaller.py` + `aizee uninstall`): per-category keep/delete, optional zip backup, preserves learned data (memory/state/brain/.env) by default. 23 tests.
- **GUI uninstaller** (`runtime/uninstaller_gui.py` + `aizee uninstall --gui`): tkinter GUI with Treeview of categories, Keep/Delete toggle, backup path picker, live log output, threaded execution. 7 tests.
- **Update script** (`scripts/update.py` + `update.bat`): git pull from GitHub, compare local vs remote, pull if behind, re-run post-install hooks (pip install, MCP sync, CLI shim, memory ingest). Preserves learned data.
- **Brain backup** (`scripts/backup_brain.py` + `backup.bat`): backs up memory/, state/, brain/, graphify-out/, .env to `aizee-backup-<date>-<time>/` folder. Metadata file included.
- **Brain restore** (`scripts/restore_brain.py` + `restore.bat`): restores from backup folder, overwrites existing data, `--list` flag shows available backups.
- **Smart auto-merge restore** (`restore.bat` / `restore_brain.py --auto`): reads checkpoint from `state/restore_checkpoint.json`, merges all backups newer than last restore. Memory is merged by timestamp (INSERT new, UPDATE if source is newer, SKIP if older). state/brain/.env take the latest backup's version. Checkpoint updated after each merge. Prevents duplicate processing.
- **One-click .bat launchers**: `update.bat`, `backup.bat`, `restore.bat`, `uninstall.bat` — double-click on Windows, no terminal needed.
- **Kubernetes manifests** (`deploy/k8s/`): Deployment, Service, PVCs, Secret, NetworkPolicy, HelmRelease. Production-ready with securityContext, readiness/liveness probes, resource limits.
- **Performance benchmarks** (`runtime/perf_benchmark.py`): Kernel.act, persona.detect, skill.list, memory.search with mean/median/p95/p99 stats. JSON output mode.

### Fixed — P0/P1 from full audit
- **`spec.md` created**: aiZee now dogfoods its own spec-driven workflow.
- **ruff exclusions removed**: `tests/*` and `skills/*` no longer excluded from linting.
- **mypy exclusions removed**: `tests/`, `dashboard/`, `scripts/` no longer excluded from type checking.
- **`--strict-markers` added** to pytest config: unknown markers now error instead of passing silently.
- **`ActionSchema` documented**: `extra="allow"` is intentional for dynamic action params; added docstring + `ge=0` constraints on `tokens`/`cost`.
- **PROPOSAL + FREELANCE personas merged**: 20 → 19 personas. FREELANCE now covers both proposal writing and platform bidding.
- **Dictatorship/Warlord tone softened**: `[DICTATORSHIP]` → `[STANDARDS]`, "God-Tier SRE & Cloud Dictator" → "Principal SRE & Cloud Architect", "SecOps Warlord" → "SecOps Specialist", "Google Play Ecosystem Warlord" → "Google Play Ecosystem Expert".
- **Dashboard auth warning**: prints explicit security warning when no token is set. Env vars renamed to `AIZEE_DASHBOARD_*` with legacy fallback.
- **subprocess audit**: all 30+ subprocess calls confirmed using list args (shell=False default). No shell=True in production code.
- **Memory.md/state conflict resolved**: all rules now point to `Memory.md` at root (not `state/MEMORY.md`). `state/` remains gitignored for runtime data.

- Dashboard CORS, token auth, CSRF, request-size, and origin-trust fixes.
- MCP path-traversal and input-validation fixes.
- SQL injection fixed in `memory/store.py`, `hybrid.py`, `graph.py` (whitelisted column/table names).
- Hardcoded `D:/.ai` paths removed from `.devin/mcp_config.json` and `.claude/settings.json`.
- Stub adapters in `aizee_mcp/adapters.py` completed/removed with tracking ticket.
- MIT LICENSE added (2024-2025, Moataz Ahmed).

## [4.22.0]

### Added
- New test discipline rule `[TEST-07]`: full `php artisan test` is extreme-necessity-only; when unavoidable, use the fastest targeted form (`--filter`, `--testsuite`, direct Pest/PHPUnit, `--parallel --stop-on-failure`) or skip tests.
- `[graphify]` optional dependency (`graphifyy>=0.8.20,<0.8.21`) and updated `Dockerfile`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1` to build `integrity.manifest` and `graphify-out/` after all source files are present.
- Budget `period` enforcement: `session`/`hourly`/`daily`/`weekly`/`monthly` with per-process session isolation and atomic `BudgetManager`/`AuditLogger` locks.
- Policy engine validates rule schema, loads all `runtime/policies/*.yaml` files, and skips malformed rules instead of crashing.
- Hybrid context retrieval: `VectorMemory.search` allowlist filtering, `MemoryStore.search_vector(kind/source)`, `aizee query`, MCP `query_context`, `ingest_memory`, and `search_memory_vector(kind)`.
- Memory ingestion now covers `skills/` (recursive) and `AGENTS.md`, validates AI file structure, and batches source deletions with relation cleanup.
- CLI `aizee query` for combined FTS + vector search.
- AGENTS.md canonical cross-tool instruction.
- Tool-specific adapters: `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/`, `.clinerules/`, `.windsurfrules`, `.aider.conf.yml`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Runtime kernel: policy, budget, workflow runner.
- Memory service: temporal SQLite-backed memory store with FTS5 and optional vector index.
- Audit logging (`state/audit.log`) for policy, budget, and workflow events.
- MCP server built on FastMCP exposing rules, workflows, memory, policy, and vector search.
- CLI `aizee` with `--root`, `AIZEE_ROOT`, `check --args`, `memory vector`, and `run --context`.
- Dashboard with auto-refresh, CORS, optional bearer auth, and audit endpoint.
- `pyproject.toml`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest` suite, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and CI workflow.
- Root discovery via `config.py` using `AIZEE_ROOT` or install directory.
- Safe AST-based policy evaluator (no `eval`).

### Changed
- Removed all hardcoded `D:/server/.ai` paths.
- `WorkflowRunner` now uses durable SQLite state and `list_workflows` naming.
- `MemoryStore` uses `row_factory`, FTS5, and `rowid`-based relations.

### Changed
- `pyproject.toml` dependency pins now include upper major-version bounds.
- `mypy` exclude regexes now correctly ignore `tests/`, `skills/`, and `scripts/`.

### Removed
- Dead `scripts/ai_memory_engine.py` and `scripts/requirements-memory.txt` (superseded by `memory/vector.py`).

### Security
- Policy `condition` no longer uses `eval`.
- `LIKE` wildcards escaped in memory search.
- Dashboard supports `AGENT_OS_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` bearer auth.
- `aizee` CLI `check` accepts JSON args only, no shell execution.
