[UPDATED] 2026-10-26
[NOTES]
- **2026-10-26 — Viral-repos study: 16 repos + growth diagnosis**: User-supplied screenshots -> cloned depth-1 to `temp/star-repos/` (FCC, Pixelle-Video, hackingtool, ds2api, DeepTutor, ml-intern, cua, FinceptTerminal, LiteRT-LM, OpenSpec, paperless-ngx, openscreen, CADAM, artemis, beamer, Agent-Reach); report `.ai/star-repos-report.md`. Top adoptions queued: doctor-as-MCP-tool w/ verdict+next_steps (artemis), uniform MCP envelope + meta.cost/meta.update (Agent-Reach), `aizee find|goal` NL discovery (hackingtool), OpenSpec change-folder artifact flow for spec_engine, root SKILL.md + `skill link` for external agents, provider failover chain + token-compression middleware (FCC), `verify` dial per action. Growth diagnosis (stars=5, forks=0, topics=[], 0 releases, discussions off): repo named `ai-globals` != product `aizee`; **`pip install aizee` in README is 404 on PyPI** (never published); no demo GIF; abstract positioning; zero distribution surface (no topics/site/registries/awesome-lists). Fix order in report.
- **2026-10-24 — Design-intelligence pass: 12-repo study + design-db + tiered slop verifier**: Studied 12 viral "AI UI" repos (cloned to `temp/ui-repos/`, report in `.ai/ui-repos-report.md`). Adopted: (1) `design-db/` — vendored MIT CSV corpus from nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill (88 styles, ~50 product palettes, font pairings, icons, UX guidelines, charts, landing patterns, GSAP motion, stacks/*.csv) + new `runtime/design_db.py` BM25-ish engine (synonym normalization, naive stemming, honest-empty fallback, variance/motion/density dials 1-10). (2) `DesignSlopVerifier` rewritten as tiered catalog — 44 rules ported from impeccable (Apache-2.0)/hallmark/taste-skill: FLOOR (non-waivable: lorem, fake data, icon-only buttons, missing focus, layout-prop animation, 100vw, reduced-motion missing, low contrast, tiny/skipped text), REFLEX (waivable via `waive:<rule-id>` comments), FINISH advisories. (3) `DesignLibrary.installed_brands`/`catalog_brands` split (CATALOG advertised 56 vs 3 on disk — now honest) + `validate()` lint (frontmatter, hex tokens, WCAG AA contrast pairs) per google-labs-code/design.md spec. (4) New `aizee design` CLI group: search/system/slop/lint/brands/domains/stacks — design_library + design_slop_verifier got real callers, removed from CONSTRUCTED_ONLY_SERVICES. Reference-only (Commons Clause): react-bits, canvas-ui. Roadmap: judge_fn browser loop, MCP design tool (needs manifest re-lock), seed frontmatter migration. Gotcha: CLI resolves AIZEE_ROOT (deployment mirror) — test with `aizee --root .` in dev. Tests: pytest via `py -3.10` (3.15 lacks deps).
- **2026-10-23 — REA engines installed + rea-cli wrapper (Node fixed)**: Ghidra `12.1.4` (verified release line) + Temurin JDK `21.0.12.1` extracted under a local `installed software/` dir on the data drive (nothing on C:). System `node` is a write-protected manual dir at a sibling `nodejs/` (24.22.0, not the nvm symlink — `nvm use` retargets `%ProgramFiles%\nodejs` which isn't on PATH) → `rea-cli.mjs` wrapper next to the aizee root resolves `$NVM_HOME/v<.nvmrc>/node.exe` (24.22.1) and injects `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` + `JAVA_HOME` per invocation (local jdk-21 overrides env when env major<21; global JAVA_HOME stays at scoop jdk17 for other tools). `setx GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` done for global discovery. Verified: `node ../rea-cli.mjs doctor` → node/ghidra/java/native-authority all healthy; `analyze whoami.exe` routed through real Ghidra 12.1.4 headless → PE segments/procedures/strings with Evidence tiers. reverse-engineering-lord rule 7 + useful-repos entry now name `rea-cli.mjs` as the canonical invocation.
- **2026-10-23 — REA local install (sibling checkout, resident tool)**: User wanted REA usable on the machine without folding it into the runtime. Full clone lives OUTSIDE the repo at sibling `../rea` next to the aizee root (env override `REA_HOME`, documented in `.env.example` incl. BYO-engine vars GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR/HOPPER_LAUNCHER_PATH/REA_IDA_MCP_CONFIG/REA_JADX_MCP_JAR). Built runnable: repo pins Node 24.22.1 (system 24.22.0 fails engines) → nvm-installed 24.22.1 used ONLY for this checkout (no `nvm use`; invoke `node "$REA_HOME/scripts/rea.mjs"`); `native/windows/build/{manifest.json,rea-windows-x64.node}` restored from the official `rea-agents@6.7.0` tarball (git checkout lacks it; `npm run build:windows-native` needs MSVC). Verified: `rea.mjs --version` 6.7.0, doctor runs (engines/registrations absent = expected), `analyze-javascript-application` on 414 files → full Evidence/unknowns output. Registry entry in `tech-stack/useful-repos.md`; reverse-engineering-lord rule 7 now prefers the local checkout over npx. temp/rea scratch clone removed.
- **2026-10-23 — REA re-verification (temp/rea re-cloned, HEAD = rea-agents@6.7.0 = latest npm)**: Integration state verified: canonical registration OK (`aizee_mcp/config.json` + `plugins.yaml` enabled + reverse-engineering-lord skill live). Gap: `rea` NOT in the Devin IDE client config — doctor reports `config_drift` on the global client mcp_config (skill/MCP registered for aizee end-users, not for this agent session). Zero analysis engines installed (Hopper/Ghidra/IDA/JADX/Kuna absent) → only built-in static analyzers usable (JS/Electron, .NET, APK signature, IL2CPP metadata, Go/Rust build-info, Godot PCK, PyInstaller, PE certs, ELF notes, model files). Node 24.22.0 runs CLI fine. Adoptable-remaining: obligation-ledger closure model (candidate for spec_engine verify), lifecycle-ownership doctrine for process supervision, tool-shape taxonomy (inspect/search/trace/compare/workflow/observe) for MCP naming.
- **2026-10-22 — REA (morluto/rea) integration + Arabic persona-detection fix**: (1) **Detector blind spot** — personas.yaml had Arabic keywords only for marketing/design/CV/freelance; every engineering persona scored 0.0 on Arabic-only prompts → always fell back to ARCH. Fix: Arabic keywords added to all engineering personas (QA/DEV/SEC/ARCH/DATA/ML/API/SRE/DEVOPS/GAME/PLAY/MOBILE/PERF/DOC/LEGAL/PRODUCT/DEVX/MLOPS/FINOPS) + Arabic orthography normalization (alef/taa variants, diacritics, و/ف/ب/ك/ل/ال prefixes, pronominal suffixes) in runtime/persona.py — verified "اختبر الكود وصلح المشكله" → QA. (2) **Export drift** — the skill_routing orphan-purge left 70 names in runtime/__init__.py __all__ with no backing module (PersonaDetectorV2, SkillRouter, …) → `from runtime import X` ImportError; __all__ trimmed to resolvable names and new `check_runtime_exports` in validate-globals.py fails on unresolvable exports (the check that would have caught it; accepts both mod.py and package dirs — task_contract is a package). (3) **REA adoptions** — runtime/evidence.py EvidenceTier(observation/derivation/inference/unknown)+EvidenceLedger wired into security scan (pattern matches=OBSERVATION, gitignored-.env downgrade + advisory-db findings=DERIVATION); AIZEE_MCP_INPUT_SCHEMA_PROFILE=compact (aizee_mcp/schema_profile.py) strips advertised schemas post-manifest-lock, full stays default; codemode executor retries kill() once and reports cleanup_pending — cleanup failure never drops ownership; install.ps1 -PlanJson + update.py --dry-run [--json] emit pre-mutation plans (paths/backups/changes/post-steps); skills/reverse-engineering-lord adapted from reverse-engineer-anything (MIT); rea-agents@6.7.0 registered in config.json+plugins.yaml. (4) detect_persona() defaults via PersonaDetector.DEFAULT not a literal. Gotcha: RUF001/RUF003 flag Arabic literals — noqa only the flagged lines (warn_unused_ignores is on); default python is 3.15 sans deps — run gates with `py -3.10`.
- **2026-10-15 — Second maintenance cycle (implementation_plan.md): version truth + security wiring + orphan purge**: (1) **Version drift** — prior release commit claimed 6.3.0 but `pyproject.toml`/config fallback stayed 6.2.0 → now genuinely 6.3.0 everywhere; CHANGELOG got a real `[6.3.0]` section. (2) **Manifest lock hardened** — `_verify_manifest_lock` fingerprints `description + parameters` (input schema) per tool, not description alone; tools without parameters keep legacy fingerprint (backward compatible); one-time re-baseline needed (delete `state/mcp_locks/aizee.json`). (3) **`aizee security mcp`** — `McpAuditor` (14 detectors) cli-wired; JSONC-tolerant config parsing (Cursor/VSCode configs have comments/trailing commas — `_jsonc_loads` is a string-state machine, not regex); `--lock` persists rug-pull baselines. (4) **Supply-chain stage in `security scan`** — `SupplyChainGuard` as built-in stage; big FP lesson: hand-rolled stdlib subsets always lie → use `sys.stdlib_module_names`; first-party modules (root dirs, `*.py` stems, sibling files 1-deep, go.mod `module`, composer psr-4) are NOT external deps; import↔dist aliases (`yaml`↔`pyyaml`) mapped in `_PY_IMPORT_TO_PKG`; per-(file,top) dedupe; `scan_source()` also wires it into `lint_python` advisory. (5) **MCP annotations** — `_annotate_tools()` post-registration sets `readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint`/`destructiveHint` on 31 tools via `_tool_manager` (same private API the RBAC wrapper already uses). (6) **22 orphans deleted** (129→107 canonical modules, ~33 test files) — gotcha: two ORPHAN_MODULES entries were WRONG (`budget_escalation` imported by `budget.py`, `service_catalog` by `agent_discovery.py` — always verify before deleting); AST trimmer removed orphan blocks from 20+ mixed gap test files; `runtime/taint` guardrail registration needs an explicit `import runtime.taint` in tests now that `reasoning_graph` (its old transitive carrier) is gone — kernel.py does the same pattern. (7) Scanner dedup — (rule,file,line) collapse + bandit/ruff same-line. (8) Deps within pins: mcp 2.3.0, pydantic 2.14.1, cryptography 50.0.2, turbovec 1.1.2, graphifyy 0.9.91, ruff 0.17.1, mypy 2.4.0.
- **2026-10-08 — v6.2.0 shipped: all audit P0s closed (truth & termination)**: User mandated fix-everything + full re-verify loop. Shipped: (1) **C1** codemode subprocess isolation — `runtime/codemode/_child.py` protocol runner, timeout `kill()`s the child (guaranteed termination); enforcement stays parent-side via call/result proxy so all 16 legacy executor tests pass unchanged. (2) **C2** conftest pins `AIZEE_ROOT` to repo root before kernel/memory imports — suite hermetic; doctor prints env-vs-code-root divergence note. Audit's "24 rootless Kernel() sites" evidence was WRONG (zero exist; real vector = direct env reads in crypto/plugin discovery) — corrected in AUDIT_REPORT. (3) **H3** `AIZEE_SECURITY_STRICT=1` fail-closed on all kernel init guards; lenient mode records `kernel.disabled_defenses` → `status()` + red `DEGRADED` doctor line. (4) **H4** quarantine now `logging.error` + `budget.state_quarantined` flag → status()/doctor; `AIOS_ENCRYPTION_KEY(_FILE)` documented in `.env.example`. (5) **H1/H5** status() labels `"constructed"`/`"cli-wired"` + `constructed_only_services`; doctor prints wiring-truth table from `kernel.ORPHAN_MODULES`/`CONSTRUCTED_ONLY_SERVICES` (single source). `audit_signer` now wired (`AuditLogger(signer=)`, every entry Ed25519-signed, `verify_chain` reports `signatures_checked/unchecked`); `aizee policy lint` wired (PL001-007; PL002 disjunction false-positive fixed — `a==X or a==Y` ≠ contradiction). (6) Docs truth: sync_docs canonical counts are 129 modules/140 skills/63 numbered workflows (of 77 md)/265 stack/7537 AST tests — badges were RIGHT, audit's 143/77/273 claims were wrong; real drift was spec.md (3888 tests/69%/345 mypy files → 7637/100%/201) + "43 tools"→39 + Tests badge→7537. mcp_client clientInfo now `config.VERSION` (can't drift). New tests: test_codemode_subprocess, test_audit_wired_signing, test_kernel_strict_mode, test_cli_wiring_v62. spec-converge CI deferred — no `specs/` dir in this repo (it's per-feature, not a docs check; sync_docs --check already enforces docs).
- **2026-10-06 — Deep audit (3 delegated passes, every claim re-verified) delivered to docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md + docs/CAPABILITIES.md + docs/WORLD_CLASS_GAP.md**: Baseline gates green except validate-globals (fixed: 3 deliverable refs added to IGNORED_FILE_REFS per existing convention, gate now Errors=0). Fixes shipped + tested: audit-log gaps in `kernel.py` act() ValidationError path + `policy_manager.py` guardian REQUIRE_APPROVAL outcome (tests added); `agent_baseline.py:284` bare-except narrowed to (IndexError, TypeError). Verified-good: MCP inbound RBAC+gateway wrap on BOTH registration paths (incl. late-added tools), FTS5 token-quoting, rowid tiebreak, WAL pool, dashboard SEC-W1, APL MODIFY/OBSERVE wired, secrets-in-prompts BLOCK (agent_gateway REDACT is responses-only); full tier re-measured 7,634 passed / 100.00% cov. Verified-theater: 20 v5.13/v5.14 services + audit_signer + design_library/design_slop_verifier are KERNEL-ATTR-ONLY (status() "active" strings mask dead services, kernel.py:1016-1034); 25 orphans incl. service_catalog, supply_chain_guard, dual_llm, PersonaDetectorV2, quality, commands; doctor reports file-existence as health. Critical/architectural OPEN: (1) codemode daemon-thread timeout escape — needs process-based timeout; (2) AIZEE_ROOT env-precedence (config.py:11-18) let dev runs mutate the deployment mirror (budget.json quarantined live; conftest has no root pin; 24 ambient Kernel() test sites) — recommend one-line conftest pin; (3) budget encryption key root-dependent (crypto.py auto key) → silent quarantine+defaults on root switch. Drift: full-tier 100% is real; harness floor 68 (its subset measures 91.61%) vs spec.md "3888 tests/69%" badly stale; counts 143 skills/77 workflows/273 stack vs badge 140/63/265; mypy canonical 204 files vs "345"; all installed packages WITHIN pins (old env-drift notes stale). Audit scratch files deleted after consolidation.
- **2026-10-06 — v6.1.0 shipped: lean-surface cleanup + upgrade hygiene**: User mandate: fix everything, never sync the aizee mirror, verify install/update remove retired files, protect new users, fix version+README. Shipped: (1) `aizee_mcp/config.json` `disabledToolModules` — 7 marketing tool modules gated at auto-discover AND fallback (registered tools ~102→43; code kept, remove name to re-enable). (2) `scripts/stale_files.txt` consumed by `install.ps1`/`install.sh`/`update.py::_remove_stale_files` (path-escape refused, `..`/absolute skipped) — install/update now deletes retired paths from existing installs while preserving state/brain/.env; verified against simulated install. `update.py` MCP-verify floor fixed 7→3. `mcp_global_sync.py` overwrites global config → stale servers vanish for existing users. (3) Test tree consolidated: `runtime|memory|eval|aizee_mcp/tests/` → `tests/{runtime,memory,eval,aizee_mcp}/` — pyproject testpaths=["tests"], conftest markers, sync_docs testpaths=("tests",), fast-tier --ignore paths, 4 `__file__` parents[] sites fixed; `git mv` chokes on deleted tracked files — use `mv`+git rename detection. (4) Dead `runtime/plugin_system.py` removed (0 plugin.json manifests; `runtime/plugin.py` is THE plugin manager); `kernel.plugin_registry` removed. (5) `design-library/` shipped: 3 original seeds (editorial/midnight/minimal); catalog brands without files load→None (by design). (6) Memory.md compacted 747→145 via `aizee memory compact` (archive in memory/archive/). (7) Version 6.1.0 everywhere incl. mcp_client clientInfo + validate-globals.ps1. (8) Injection "3 implementations" resolved: they're a STACK — injection_detector (deterministic L1) → prompt_injection_detector (2-stage wrapper) → guardrails/prompt_injection (conservative input adapter) — docstring clarified. Gates: full suite 7633 passed/100% cov in 2:07 via `aizee test --full --xdist` (sequential was ~10min; xdist flag exists but off by default), ruff+mypy(204)+validate-globals(540)+sync_docs all green. Mirror D:\server\aizee NOT synced per user instruction.
- **2026-10-06 — External-repo adoptions shipped (banks/reflect + skill lifecycle + cli-first)**: (1) hindsight → `memory/store.py`: `bank` namespace column (additive migration, `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'global'` + `idx_mem_bank` created in `_ensure_bank_column` — NOT in `_index_sql`, because `_init_schema` runs before the ALTER on old DBs and `CREATE INDEX` on a missing column crashes init), bank filters on all read paths, `banks()` listing, `reflect()` extractive/LLM synthesis + `ReflectResult`; schema_contract v4; MCP `reflect_memory`/`list_memory_banks` + `bank` param; CLI `aizee memory banks|reflect --bank`. Gotcha: MagicMock tool tests fail json.dumps on new Memory fields — set `bank="global"` on mocks. (2) autoharness → `runtime/skill_lifecycle.py` `SkillLifecycleManager` (probation/graduation/capacity/fold) wired as `kernel.skill_lifecycle` + `aizee skill lifecycle`; Kernel class needs the attr declared class-level for mypy. (3) agent-reach → `skills/cli-first-access.md` flat skill (CLI + probe over MCP servers). Dead runtime modules removed earlier this session: a2a_server, agentic_security, audit_workflow, codegraph, error_classifier, provider_registry, sarif_emitter, semantic_search, skill_eval, sql_injection_guard (+their tests) — docs now say 129 modules.
- **2026-10-06 — MCP surface slimmed to core 3 + ads-toggle leak fixed**: Canonical `aizee_mcp/config.json` now defines only `aizee`, `graphify`, `context7` (was 33); `.devin/mcp_config.json` same; `plugins.yaml` 31 external plugins `enabled:false` (code2video/graphify/context7 kept); install.ps1/install.sh templates trimmed; global `%APPDATA%\devin\mcp_config.json` rewritten (3 servers). Root-cause bug: disable lists used `google-ads`/`meta-ads`/`tiktok-ads`/`linkedin-ads` (hyphens) but servers register as `*_ads` (underscores) — toggles never matched, ads MCPs stayed live in IDE sessions. Fixed in `.devin/mcp_config.local.json` + `state/settings.json`. Note: `aizee_mcp/tools/*` (ads/social/email/seo/analytics/cro/freelance) are pure local tool modules — still auto-register (no external deps); ~75/~115 tool fns are marketing-domain. Marketing runtime block (kernel `_init_core_services` L199-229) still lazy-loads 12 modules. Mirror `D:\server\aizee` still has old 33-server config until `update_aizee.bat` runs. External-repo study in `temp/`: agent-reach (skill+doctor over upstream CLIs — zero-wrapper channel model), autoharness (self-learning skill lifecycle: probation/graduation/capacity/fold-ledger — candidate for `runtime/learning_loop` upgrade), hindsight (retain/recall/reflect + banks + mental models — heavy pg+LLM; adopt ops-model optionally, not the server). Audit findings pending user approval (dead modules, dual plugin systems, missing design-library dir, Memory.md >500 lines).
- **2026-09-30 — pytest fast tier (6.7k tests): 15min+ → ~83s via `-n 12`**: Root causes measured: root `conftest.py` `from memory.store import MemoryStore` pulled `sentence_transformers`→`transformers`→`torch` (~7.6s per process AND per xdist worker — that was why `-n` lost on Windows); autouse per-test `gc.collect()` ~0.1s on a growing heap (~11min of pure GC); `-m` deselect still imports excluded dirs. Fixes: lazy `_resolve_sentence_transformer()` + `_ST_UNSET` sentinel in `memory/vector.py` (patch points preserved — tests patching `vector_module.SentenceTransformer` unaffected); conftest GC boot window (`gc.disable()` at import → `gc.freeze()`+`gc.set_threshold(50_000,20,20)`+`gc.enable()` in `pytest_collection_modifyitems`; PostHog/Instagram pattern) + per-test collect amortized to every 64; `aizee test` fast tier now `--ignore=`s tests/{mcp,dashboard,e2e}+test_vector.py. Measured: `memory.store` import 8.6s→0.58s; 153-test subset 25s→2.1s sequential (xdist -n8: 3.5s — spawn cost wins only at scale); collection 18.7s→~5s. Also fixed env-drift failure `test_noop_without_sdk` (opentelemetry-api installed transitively → simulate absence via `sys.modules[pkg]=None` + reset `_warned`) and a stale `# type: ignore` in tracing_otel.py. New rules: `tech-stack/pytest-8.md` 26-33. Follow-up available: `pytest-testmon` (affected-only selection), `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`, `pytest-zygote` (POSIX/WSL only), Defender exclusion, WSL2.
- **2026-09-29 — Full-project evolution audit (ARCH persona + 5 lords)**: User asked (AR) to adopt personas, read whole project, and map what needs evolving. Method: `aizee persona detect --multi` -> ARCH + ai-agents-architect + {agent-governance, agent-orchestration, ai-code-review, ai-observability, ai-redteam} lords. Cross-referenced `temp/competitor-study-v3/ANALYSIS.md` (45 ideas) + `.ai/repos-report.md` against live code. State: v5.17.0, 136 runtime modules, 141 skills, 77 workflows, 266 stack refs, doctor 46/46 ok, tree clean. Verified finding: `AgentGateway` exported+tested but NOT wired into `Kernel.act()` chain or `aizee_mcp` tool path (MCP tools pass rbac.check_tool_permission only; `check_mcp_tool` exists but not enforced server-side); `prompt_gate`/`output_gate` live only in chat path -> ARCH-06 governance-theater risk. Other verified gaps: no eval/chaos.py, no `aizee heal`, no APL modify/observe policy verdicts, no output.pre_send/memory.pre_write lifecycle hooks, no memory pin/soft-delete/contradiction-resolution, injection_detector lacks L2 embedding + L3 judge layers, dual_llm lacks schema-enforced worker output, no MCP 2026-07-28 per-request protocolVersion/header routing, no A2A server-side (client adapter only), no runtime/codemode (token-reduction YES item never built), Memory.md auto-truncation still open. Env drift to verify: pytest 9.1.1 vs pin <9.0, pytest-cov 7.1.0 vs <7.0, graphifyy 0.8.20 vs >=0.9.16,<0.9.17. Doc drift: spec.md says 134 runtime modules (actual 136). Recommendation handed to user as P0/P1/P2 roadmap; no code changes this session.
- **2026-09-29 — v6.0.0 shipped: entire P0-P2 roadmap implemented**: User mandated full implementation + audit-to-zero-errors + README. Shipped: **`runtime/enforcement.py`** unified stack — outbound MCP (McpClient + McpAgent + workflow mcp steps): firewall -> AgentGateway request guardrails -> exec -> response guardrails; inbound aizee_mcp tools: RBAC + gateway wrap (firewall excluded — its require_approval catch-all would ask on every internal call); `Kernel.act()` gained PRE_LLM prompt-field injection/secret-leak scan after Probity; **`injection_detector` L2** (sentence-transformers embedding layer, optional) + **L3** (LLM-judge, pluggable callable); **`dual_llm`** Pydantic `WorkerOutput` schema enforcement (free-text quarantine now unrepresentable); **`mcp_protocol.py`** dual-era negotiation (2025-11-25 legacy / 2026-07-28 stateless, Mcp-Method/Mcp-Name headers, per-request protocolVersion check) wired into both client initialize paths; **APL verdicts** `MODIFY`/`OBSERVE` end-to-end (enums->schema->engine->kernel gate); **lifecycle hooks** `output.pre_send` (kernel.chat_message) + `memory.pre_write` (MemoryStore.add_batch); **`eval/chaos.py`** 9-fault injector + error budgets; **memory lifecycle** `pinned`+`deleted_at` columns (additive migration, schema_contract updated), pin-first ordering, soft-delete hidden from all read paths, contradiction resolution; **`runtime/heal.py`** + `aizee heal [--apply]` — dry-run default, safe fixes only, `.env` UTF-8 re-encode w/ .bak, additive memory migration; **per-PR budgets** (`budgets.pr` template, `pr:<id>` usage never period-resets, `check(pr_id=)`); **`eval/release_gate.py`** reliability gate (priority_ladder) invoked by `runtime/ci.py` subprocess; **`runtime/codemode/`** sandboxed executor (plugin AST scanner: no os/subprocess/eval/exec/open/dunder/`__builtins__`, daemon-thread timeout, enforcement pre/post tool-call) + `aizee codemode`; **`runtime/a2a_server.py`** stdlib loopback A2A server (bearer auth, /.well-known/agent-card.json, JSON-RPC tasks/send|get|cancel, kernel-routed); **bi-temporal** `MemoryStore.as_of`/`search_as_of` (created_at=tx-time, valid_from/to=valid-time, deleted_at tombstone); **`memory/compactor.py`** Memory.md compaction (741->139 lines dry-run); **`runtime/bootstrap.py`** + `aizee bootstrap` PyPI-path installer; **`runtime/overengineering.py`** + **`runtime/curriculum.py`**. Bugs fixed en route: `.env` Windows-1252 crash in `_load_secrets_once` (errors="replace"), StrEnum on py3.10, ThreadPoolExecutor timeout hang (daemon thread), memory schema-drift contract, Windows clock-granularity flaky as_of tests (controlled timestamps), kernel budget semantics (projected>=max). Version 6.0.0 synced across pyproject/manifest/.aizee-version/config.py/validators/READMEs; CHANGELOG 6.0.0; sync_docs: runtime=142 skills=139 workflows=63 stack=265 tests=7653; validate-globals 0/0; ruff+mypy(432) clean; full suite pending at audit close. Gotcha: `AIZEE_ROOT` env was pointing at read-only `D:\server\aizee` mirror — heal dry-run correctly flagged its broken .env; all work confined to working root.
- **2026-09-29 — PyO3/coverage flake root-caused and fixed**: Intermittent `ImportError: PyO3 modules ... may only be initialized once per interpreter process` under `pytest --cov` was NOT a dual-install issue. Mechanism: coverage resolves dotted `--cov=runtime` sources via `importlib.util.find_spec`, which **executes `runtime/__init__.py` during `pytest_load_initial_conftests`** → eager chain imports `audit_signing` → `cryptography` `_rust.pyd` init inside that reentrant context fails (PyO3 once-guard), poisoning every later crypto import in the session (masked by audit_signing's fallback warning). Fix: switched `--cov` sources to **path form** (`--cov=runtime/` etc.) in `aizee_cli.py::cmd_test` + `eval/harness.py` — path sources skip module resolution entirely. Documented as `tech-stack/pytest-8.md` rule 25. Also removed a stray duplicate `cryptography` 45.0.7 user-site install (Program Files 46.0.7 remains, satisfies `>=42,<52`).
- **2026-09-29 — v6 coverage closes + real fixes found in the pass**: `memory/store.py` `latest_wins` contradiction resolution used `created_at` alone — Windows ~15.6ms clock granularity ties picked the OLDER row; fixed with `rowid` insertion-order tiebreak. `injection_detector` dedup keyed on `source_label` — head/tail overlap at same absolute offset double-counted and raw/decoded scans shared coordinate space; fixed by deduping per coordinate space. All v6 modules driven to 100% coverage (30+ files: enforcement, injection L1-L3, dual_llm schema, mcp_protocol, agent_gateway, a2a_server, codemode executor, heal, overengineering, curriculum, chaos, release_gate, compactor, store, hook_lifecycle, mcp_orchestrator, mcp_client, aizee_mcp agent+server gateway paths, dashboard server, bootstrap, workflow_manager, policy APL).

[UPDATED] 2026-08-17
[NOTES]
- Integrated architecture patterns from two open-source repos (spec-kit + Floci):
  - **spec-kit (P0)**: 5 SDD templates in `tech-stack/spec-driven-templates/` (spec/plan/tasks/constitution/checklist). `SpecEngine` gained `scaffold_spec/plan/tasks/checklist()`, `set_constitution()`, `validate_checklist()`, `analyze_artifacts()` (cross-artifact consistency: coverage/ambiguity/underspecification/constitution violations), `converge_to_code()` (codebase gap analysis: missing/partial/contradicts + suggested tasks). Workflows 22-spec-analyze + 23-spec-converge. 29 tests in `test_spec_engine_templates.py`.
  - **Floci (P0-P1)**: `runtime/storage_backend.py` (StorageBackend protocol + InMemory/JSON/SQLite + StorageFactory with path-caching + lifecycle mgmt). `runtime/service_catalog.py` (ServiceDescriptor frozen dataclass + ServiceCatalog 6-index lookup + match_trigger/match_tech_stack + build_catalog_from_directory). `runtime/schemas.py` gained AizeeError hierarchy (PolicyDeniedError/BudgetExceededError/ValidationError/StorageError) + PaginatedResult + ErrorSeverity enum. AGENTS.md expanded with Floci-style sections (Architecture, Package Layout, First Principles, Error Handling, Storage Rules, Common Mistakes, Human Handoff). 69 tests (41 storage + 28 catalog).
- Gates green: ruff ✅, mypy ✅ (3 new files), pytest ✅ (2526 total, 170 backward-compat passed). No regressions in existing MemoryStore/SkillResolver/spec_engine.
- Counts: 78 skills, 38 workflows, 81 tech-stack refs, 37 test files, 2526 tests.
- Domain gap note: Floci is Java/Quarkus AWS emulator — no code copied, only architectural patterns adapted. spec-kit is same domain (SDD) — templates + analyze/converge logic adapted.

[UPDATED] 2026-08-15
[NOTES]
- Flutter skills suite added: 3 skills (`flutter-architect` combined, `flutter-design` UX, `flutter-developer` MOBILE) + `tech-stack/flutter.md` (Flutter 3.47 / Dart 3.13). personas.yaml: MOBILE lords += flutter-architect/flutter-developer, UX lords += flutter-design, new lord_skills with Arabic keywords. mobile-game-producer updated to route Flutter games. manifest.json triggers added. Persona detect verified (MOBILE 0.814 + UX, lords include flutter-*). Gates green: ruff, mypy (54), pytest 1121 passed / 91.19% cov.

[UPDATED] 2026-08-11
[NOTES]
- Session: full project audit + MCP review + fixes.
- Found root-path mismatch: rules say `D:\server\.ai` but actual root is `D:\.ai`. Set `AIZEE_ROOT=D:\.ai` as permanent User env var. Rules text still references old path (cosmetic; config.discover_root() falls back correctly).
- Found `state/MEMORY.md` missing and `state/` gitignored — all rules reference it. Workaround: `Memory.md` at root is the actual file used. Recommend updating rules to point at `Memory.md`.
- `query_rules` MCP tool was substring-only and returned `[]` for "kernel policy". Upgraded to FTS5 via MemoryStore (kind=semantic, filtered to rules/) with substring fallback. File: `aizee_mcp/aizee_server.py`.
- Removed inline `import asyncio` in `aizee_server.py:run_mcp_plan` (violated no-inline-import rule). Moved to top-level import.
- `temp/` was 28,808 files / 447 MB — cleared completely per user approval.
- MCP servers verified working: `aizee` (18+ tools) + `graphify` (10 tools + 6 resources). `graph_stats`: 1879 nodes / 3224 edges / 276 communities / 93% EXTRACTED.
- Quality gates green: ruff ✅, mypy ✅ (45 files), pytest ✅ (412 passed, 91% cov), eval/harness ✅ all_pass.
- Open issues (not fixed, need decision): `adapters.py` has 3 stub adapters (Codex/ClaudeCode/RemoteA2A); `check_policy` defaults to `ask` for reads; `get_os_status` returns empty `tech_stack`; 44 untracked + 30 modified files in git.

- Expanded *-lord skills to 11 domains (database, language, cloud-platforms, devops, frontend-frameworks, backend-frameworks, messaging-streaming, search-vector, ai-ml, linux-systems, security) and compressed them to Telegraphic Pseudo-Code.
- Fixed `runtime/tech_stack.py` version detection: matches hyphenated major-minor tech-stack filenames, parses `composer.json`/`package.json` constraints when lockfiles absent, and aliases common packages.
- Fixed `Dockerfile` `state/CHANGELOG.md` COPY bug; now creates `state/`/`brain/`/`graphify-out/` directories.
- Refreshed `graphify-out/` graph.
- Refactored `dashboard/server.py`: shared kernel/memory instances, configurable CORS origin, per-IP rate limiting, POST body validation.
- Refactored `runtime/mcp_client.py` to cache stdio processes per server/root and reuse initialized stdio connections.
- Updated `workflows/README.md` file count and added 11-14 audit workflows.
- Added `runtime/policies/examples/` (api-rate-limits, data-exfiltration, time-based-access) and recursive policy loading.
- Pinned `.github/workflows/ci.yml` action SHAs (actions/checkout, actions/setup-python) and documented SBOM/Cosign release step.
- Quality gates green: ruff, mypy, pytest, `python eval/harness.py`.
- Integrated 9 AI personas into `global-roles.md` (English) and created `global-roles-ar.md` (Arabic) for agent/IDE identity charters.
- Rewrote `README.md` and `README-AR.md` with clearer quickstart, persona showcase, updated architecture, and bilingual links.
- Implemented Auto Persona Selection: `runtime/persona.py` + integration in `runtime/kernel.py`, `runtime/workflow.py`, `cli.py`, and tests.
- Added `aizee persona list/detect` and `aizee agent spawn --persona auto`.
- Added persona skills `game-architect`, `google-play-warlord`, `mobile-game-producer` with Context7 IDs and `PERSONA_SKILLS` mapping.
- Fixed CI/CD: `graphify.yml` installs `graphifyy` and creates a PR; `ci.yml`/`validate.yml` use pinned SHAs + lighter `[dev]` install + `--no-cov`.

## v4.22.1 — Installer & Update Flow Review (SRE + DEVOPS + SEC)

### ماذا يحدث عند التحديث (Update Scenario)
1. المستخدم ينزل التحديث (git pull أو نسخة جديدة).
2. يشغل `install.sh` / `install.ps1` — يكتشف الإصدار الحالي من `.aizee-version`.
3. يقارن بالإصدار الهدف من `pyproject.toml`.
4. لو نفس الإصدار → `--update` يقول "already at target".
5. لو إصدار أحدث → ينسخ الملفات (copy mode) أو يتخطى (in-place mode).
6. يحفظ `state/` و `brain/` في `state/.backups/` (دائم، ليس `/tmp/`).
7. يشغل `scripts/migrate.py` → يبني سلسلة migrations من الإصدار القديم للجديد.
8. migration 4.22.0→4.22.1: يشغل schema migrations، يتحقق من encryption، ينشئ dirs جديدة.
9. يثبت dependencies (يضيف `cryptography` للتحقق).
10. يحدّث `AIZEE_ROOT`، يبني graphify، ينشئ symlinks.
11. يكتب `.aizee-version` بالإصدار الجديد.
12. ينظف النسخ الاحتياطية القديمة (يحتفظ بـ 3).

### الإصلاحات
- **`scripts/migrate.py`**: أضيف `_migrate_4_22_to_4_22_1` — يشغل `runtime/migrations.py` schema migrations، يتحقق من encryption compatibility، ينشئ dirs جديدة.
- **`install.sh` / `install.ps1`**: النسخ الاحتياطي الآن في `state/.backups/` (دائم) بدلاً من `/tmp/` أو `$env:TEMP`. تنظيف تلقائي (يحتفظ بـ 3).
- **`install.sh` / `install.ps1`**: أضيف `cryptography` لقائمة التحقق من packages.
- **`cli.py` doctor**: أضيف فحوصات: managers module, mcp tools module, crypto, migrations, observability, LICENSE, CODEOWNERS, `aizee_mcp/API.md`, installed version, encryption key, pip packages.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: version bumped to 4.22.1.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: حدّث بالكامل بكل تغييرات P0-P2 + installer fixes.
- **Gate**: ruff ✅, mypy ✅ (58 files), pytest ✅ (599 passed, 89.06% cov), bandit ✅ (0 issues).

## v4.22.1 — MCP Windows Fix + aizee CLI Collision (SRE + DEVOPS)

### المشكلة
- **linkedin MCP (وكل wrapper-based MCP) مكسور على Windows**: `scripts/mcp_env_wrapper.py` كان يستخدم `os.execvpe()` لتشغيل الـ MCP server. على Windows، `os.execvpe` لا يورّث stdin/stdout pipe handles صح لما الـ MCP client يتكلم over stdio → السيرفر يقرأ nothing ويخرج exit 1 بصمت. ده كسر upwork/freelancer/fiverr/linkedin.
- **`aizee` CLI مُخترَق**: حزمة `octopus-linkedin` لها `cli.py` top-level في user site-packages. حزمة `aios` entry point كان `aizee = "cli:main"` → `import cli` يحلّ لـ octopus-linkedin بدل aios (collision). نتيجة: `aizee persona detect` وكل أوامر `aizee` كانت تشتغل كأنها `octopus-linkedin`.

### الإصلاحات
- **`scripts/mcp_env_wrapper.py`**: على Windows استُبدل `os.execvpe` بـ `subprocess.run` (inherited handles). POSIX فضّل `execvpe` (أكفأ). ده أصلح كل MCP servers دفعة واحدة.
- **إعادة تسمية `cli.py` → `aizee_cli.py`** (إصلاح دائم للـ collision): تحديث `pyproject.toml` (`aizee = "aizee_cli:main"`, `py-modules`), `tests/test_cli.py`, `install.ps1`/`install.sh` (shim + verification), `runtime/ci.py` + `eval/harness.py` (mypy targets), docs (README, README-AR, BOOTLOADER, MAINTENANCE_PROMPT, ACTIVE_CONTEXT). `pip install -e .` لإعادة توليد editable finder MAPPING + `aizee.exe`.
- **التحقق**: linkedin MCP رجع 28 أداة + `get_profile` رجع بيانات Moataz Ahmed. `aizee status`/`persona detect --multi` شغّال. ruff ✅, mypy ✅, `tests/test_cli.py` 23 passed.
- **ملاحظة**: `aizee.exe` في `%APPDATA%\Python\Python314\Scripts` (user Scripts، ليس على PATH) — الـ WindowsApps shim `aizee.cmd` هو اللي على PATH. لو الـ shim قديم بيشاور لـ `cli.py`، شغّل `install.ps1` لتحديثه لـ `aizee_cli.py`.

## v5.14.0 - Post-Repair Verification Pass (QA + SEC)

### الملخص
- مراجعة كاملة لكل التعديلات السابقة + فحص وظيفي لكل إصلاح + إعادة تشغيل كل البوابات على `.ai`.
- **اكتشافات جديدة في هذة الجولة**:
  - `.aizee-version` اتكتب بـ UTF-8 BOM (`\xef\xbb\xbf`) من PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` — اتصلحت بكتابة نظيفة بدون BOM.
  - `git_memory.commit()` على repo مش متهيأ كان بيرجع `False` بصمت بدل `RuntimeError` — اتصلح: `status.returncode != 0` يرفع الخطأ (fail-loud) زي العقد القديم.
  - `tests/dashboard/test_dashboard.py::test_dashboard_main_block_in_process` كان مكسور من c533957: `_BoundedThreadingHTTPServer` subclass جعل الـ MagicMock لا يرى `serve_forever` + port `0` مرفوض — اتصلح بـ stub class حقيقي + port صالح.
  - `aizee_mcp/tools/seo_tools.py` (B8): حارس الذاكرة كان يقيس RSS المطلق للعملية — تحت pytest+coverage السويت يتجاوز 512MB فيفشل crawl كله — اتصلح لقياس **النمو النسبي** من baseline عند بداية الـ crawl.
- **البوابات النهائية (AIZEE_ROOT=.ai)**: ruff OK، mypy OK (293 files)، pytest+cov OK (73.60% >= 68%)، guard_invariants OK، validate-globals OK (508 files)، sync_docs --check OK (in sync)، eval/harness.py `all_pass: true`.
- **المزامنة**: `update_aizee.bat` اتنفذ — كل الملفات المعدلة byte-identical بين `.ai` و`aizee`.

## v6.2.0 — Maintenance Pass: Lazy Kernel + MCP Lock (SEC + QA + DEV)

### الملخص
- Maintenance prompt `MAINTENANCE_PROMPT.md` — audit → `implementation_plan.md` → approved scope (P0 + P1-a/b + P2-b) executed surgically.
- **Audit headline:** ~27% of the codebase was inert — 25 orphan modules (7.6k LOC) + 20 constructed-only services (7k LOC built per `Kernel()` with no callers). Orphans kept as-is per user decision.

### التغييرات
- **P0-a MCP manifest lock:** `aizee_mcp` locks all tool manifests (name+description hashes) on first start, re-verifies every boot; drift → warning, `AIZEE_MCP_LOCK=enforce` → fail-closed abort. Lock state in `state/mcp_locks/` (gitignored).
- **P0-b Advisory lint:** `lint_python` now runs `HallucinationDetector` + `StaleApiDetector`, returns findings under `"advisory"` key (backward-compatible). Detector failure degrades to warning, never breaks lint.
- **P0-c Scanner hygiene:** intentional sandboxed `exec` in `codemode/_child.py` suppressed via `aizee-scan` marker; empty excepts in executor now log. `security scan runtime` = 0 findings (+9 suppressed).
- **P1-a Lazy `runtime/__init__.py`:** PEP 562 `__getattr__` + lazy submodules — `import runtime` 0.46s → 0.01s.
- **P1-b Lazy kernel services:** 20 constructed-only services build on first access via `Kernel.__getattr__` — `Kernel()` 0.59s → 0.13s. Security stacks (taint/guardrails/injection/design) stay eager; `AIZEE_SECURITY_STRICT=1` force-builds all lazies at boot (fail-closed preserved). 12 marketing module attrs lazy too.
- **P2-b Auto-compact:** `aizee memory ingest` runs `compact_memory()` after ingest; >500-line Memory.md compacts in place, dropped sections archived to `memory/archive/`.
- **Status truth:** lazy-built services report `"mcp-lazy"`→`"mcp-wired"` once resolved; `status()["constructed_only_services"]` unchanged; doctor wiring table updated.

### البوابات
- ruff OK, mypy OK (652 files), `aizee test --full` 7731 passed + 100% cov, `eval/harness.py` all_pass.
- **Coverage footgun:** never run `test --full` and `eval/harness.py` concurrently — both write `.coverage*` in repo root and corrupt each other (showed 33% phantom). Always sequential.

## v6.3.0+ — Research Integration Pass: ECC / agent-reach / auth-for-laravel (SEC + API)

### الملخص
- دراسة أربعة مصادر خارجية (ecc, agent-reach, auth-for-laravel, ecc.tools) واعتماد انتقائي — أفكار فقط، لا كود منقول. المرفوض (Ponytail): Plan Canvas/Control Pane UI، GitHub App، استيراد 311 سكيل، تبعية npm.

### التغييرات
- **security mcp**: كشف أسرار في `args`، بادئات أوسع (`github_pat_`, `xox*`, `AIza`, `pk_live`...)، unpinned npx/uvx + writable-path، بلا تكرار flag/value.
- **prompt-defense baseline**: حقن قسم ثابت مضاد للحقن في كل ملف قواعد مُصدَّر — لا يُحسب في `rules_emitted`.
- **`fact_force` guardrail**: العمليات الهدامة القابلة للاسترداد تتطلب facts {target, rollback}؛ الكارثية تبقى محظورة دائمًا.
- **handoffs `aizee.handoff.v1`**: `memory handoff/handoffs` — وثائق Markdown محمولة في `brain/handoffs/`.
- **نطاقات الذاكرة + حارس vault**: `--scope project|user`؛ vault المشروع يرفض الكتابة ما لم `brain/` متجاهَلة (fail-closed: `!brain/` → رفض).
- **instincts `aizee.instinct.v1`**: trigger→action بثقة 0.3→0.9؛ ملاحظة في ≥2 مشروع → ترقية project→user تلقائيًا؛ عبر `MemoryStore.update_meta` الجديدة (تعيد توقيع meta).
- **وثائق**: `tech-stack/auth-for-laravel.md`, `docs/INSTALL_CONTRACT.md` (`aizee.install.v1`).

### فخ اكتُشف
- كتابات scoped تحل vault المشروع من `--project`/`AGENT_PROJECT_ROOT` — لما `AIZEE_ROOT` يشير لمرآة النشر، الكتابات تروح لها. اختبار يدوي كتب handoff + سجل ذاكرة في `aizee\brain\` — نُظّف فورًا (ملف + صف memories + vector_id_map). دائمًا مرّر `--root`/`--project` للريبو العامل في الاختبارات.

## v6.5.0 — Star-Repo Adoption Pass: Governed Path + Discovery (ARCH + GROWTH)

### الملخص
- دراسة 16 ريبو ناجح (temp/star-repos/) ثم اعتماد انتقائي: طبقة الحوكمة اتعمقت جوّه مسار LLM نفسه، والاكتشاف والتشخيص اتعرضوا للـ agent كأدوات. التفاصيل: `.ai/star-repos-report.md`.

### التغييرات
- **`runtime/verification.py`** — `verify` (off/final/checkpoints/strict) على `kernel.act`؛ strict يشغّل plan-diff + supply-chain على الـ diff — فوق البوابات الإلزامية، مش بدلها.
- **`runtime/doctor.py` + `aizee doctor --json` + MCP `aizee_doctor`** — verdict (ready/degraded/blocked) + `next_steps` مرتبة بأوامر run.
- **`runtime/tool_envelope.py`** — envelope موحد `{ok, result|error:{code}, meta}` و3 أدوات جديدة (doctor/find/goal) بتستخدمه؛ 46 أداة مسجلة.
- **`runtime/find.py`** — `aizee find|goal "<نص>"` اكتشاف NL على catalog (skills/workflows/tech-stack).
- **`runtime/gateway_proxy.py`** — proxy محلي (anthropic/openai surfaces) بـ failover chain؛ كل request يعدّي `kernel.act("LLMRequest", verify=...)` — enforcement جوّه المسار.
- **`runtime/output_filter.py`** — ضغط حتمي لمخرجات الأدوات الكبيرة (opt-in `AIZEE_OUTPUT_FILTER=1`) سلكيًا في `_gateway_post_check`.
- **`runtime/spec/changes.py`** — فولدرز OpenSpec `specs/changes/<name>/{proposal,design,tasks}.md` + propose/archive على SpecEngine.
- **`runtime/ingest_rules.py`** — `rules/ingest.yaml` glob→bank/kind/tags جوّه `Ingestor._collect_rules`.
- **`runtime/config_ops.py`** — `config show` بـ secrets masked + `config apply --check` dry-run بـ deep-merge diff.
- **أسطح المنتج**: `SKILL.md` جذري + `aizee skill link` (ينسخ لكل harnesses) + `llms.txt` + قسم agent-contract في AGENTS.md.
- **`runtime/__init__.py`** lazy exports للوحدات الجديدة.

### Growth
- الريبو اتسمّى `m3taz-ahmed/ai-globals` → **`m3taz-ahmed/aizee`**؛ remote اتظبط.
- Description جديدة + 15 topic + discussions مفتوحة؛ release `v6.4.0` اتعمل على commit 970fd78.
- README: hook outcome-focused + جدول الأوامر الجديد + `pip install aizee` المكسور اتصلح بـ `pip install git+...` (PyPI لسه مش منشور — تحتاج credentials).
- متبقّي خارجيًا: PyPI publish، GIF demo، docs site، MCP registries، Show HN/مجتمعات — تحتاج صلاحيات مالك/حسابات.

### البوابات
- ruff OK، mypy 198 files OK، `aizee test --full` **7330 passed + 100% cov**، `eval/harness.py` all_pass، validate-globals 6.5.0 consistent (545 scanned، 0 errors).

### فخ اكتُشف
- `pytest --cov=<pkg.module>` (اسم موديول مش مسار) يخلّي pytest-cov يستورده مبكرًا → `mcp`→`cryptography` PyO3 double-init error. دايمًا استخدم مسارات (`--cov=runtime/`) زي `aizee_cli.py`.
- `PlanDiffValidator` يحتاج `+++ b/<file>` في الـ diff علشان يحدد الـ suffix؛ diff بلا header كان بيعدي بصمت.
- YAML 1.1: `verify: off` يتقري كـ `False` — GatewayConfig.load بيطبيعه للمستوى الصح.

## [2026-10-27] v6.5.0 — Star-Repos Batch-2 Adoption

### الملخص
- دراسة 7 ريبو إضافية (mimic، browser-use، agentmemory، scientific-agent-skills، diagram-design، anthropic-cybersecurity-skills، OpenViking — التفاصيل: `.ai/star-repos-report-batch2.md`) ثم تنفيذ كل التبنّيات المرشّحة.

### التغييرات
- **`runtime/skill_lint.py` + `aizee skill lint [--write-index]`** — description lint (طول+صياغة trigger+reachable) + collision detection بفلترة family-tokens (lord/architect مش تنافس) + negative-trigger exemption + توليد `skills/index.json`. كشف 74 issue + 37 collision حقيقي في مكتبتنا.
- **`runtime/skill_scan.py` + `aizee skill scan`** — فحص prompt-injection/exfil/remote-pipe/credential-request (high يفشل الفحص) — نمط Cisco skill-scanner محلي.
- **`runtime/abstracts.py` + `aizee abstract`** — L0 sidecars مولّدة + L1 overview + L2 full؛ `read_context(path, level)` (نمط OpenViking).
- **`runtime/hooks.py` + `aizee hooks install|status|fire`** — session_start (briefing L0 لـ stdout) + post_tool_failure/pre_compact/session_end (telemetry fire-and-forget لـ memory). يكتب `.claude/settings.json` + `.aizee/hooks/*.sh` (نمط agentmemory).
- **`runtime/sensitive.py` SensitiveVault** — placeholders `{NAME}`؛ inject وقت النداء، mask قبل الـ gates/audit؛ `kernel.act(sensitive_data={...})` يعمل mask تلقائيًا (نمط browser-use).
- **`runtime/api_session.py` GovernedApiSession + `aizee session from-curl|from-har`** — mimic: auth-bundle من curl/HAR/headers (KEEP/DROP rules)، كل request يعدّي `kernel.act("ApiCall")` والـ audit يشوف headers masked.
- **Gateway tiers** — `Provider.tiers` (flash/extraction) + `payload.tier`؛ dedicated providers أولاً ثم untiered fallback (نمط browser-use small-model-split).
- **`runtime/secret_scrub.py`** — scrubbing وقت الـ capture في `Ingestor._memory` (keyed secrets + prefixes + auth headers)؛ meta تحفظ `scrubbed: n` وتحذير.
- **`plugin.json`** agentskills.io manifest + `<!-- mcp-name: ... -->` في README.

### فخ اكتُشف (batch 2)
- `mypy` بيوحّد types المتغيرات جوّه scope واحد: إعادة استخدام اسم `report` بين branches (SkillReport vs dict) عمل 7 أخطاء — استخدم أسماء مميزة.
- Regex `{1,40}` بعد `[A-Z]` بيرفض placeholders قصيرة (`{T}`) — لازم `{0,40}`.
- `\b` بعد مجموعة في regex بيكسر الأنماط اللي بتنتهي بحرف غير-word (`rm -rf /`).
- `_as_tuple`/frontmatter: سكيلز `.md` المسطحة عندها name+description بس (بلا triggers) — الـ lint بيعتبرها unreachable-by-trigger وهي فعلاً كده بالنسبة لـ catalog routing.

### مراجعة ثانية كاملة (نفس اليوم)
- أمنيّة: `api_session` كان بيسمح absolute-URL cross-host + urllib بيبعت الـ auth-bundle مع 302 → رفض cross-host + `_SameHostRedirect`؛ `gateway_proxy` body-cap 10MB + prompt-gate 4k→64k؛ `sensitive.mask_obj` بيحوّل tuple→list (اتصلح).
- وثائق: `sync_docs.py` هو الـ canonical counter (runtime=124 top-level, skills=141, workflows=63/77, stack=266 — بيعد README.md في الـ glob؛ tests=7380 AST). لازم نشغّله بدل التعديل اليدوي — هو اللي بيعرف الأنماط المُدارة، وفيه unmanaged spots (badges عربي، prose، plugin.json، `.windsurfrules`) بتتظبط يدويًا بعده. SKILL.md table كان ناقصه 5 أوامر جديدة.
- `triggers:` في frontmatter = gating مش discovery — أي skill unconditional لازم `always: true` قبل إضافة triggers وإلا بيتعطّل عن الـ persona routing (test_persona_reset مسكها).

## [2026-10-27] v6.5.0 — Skill-Library Repair (lint 0/0)

### الملخص
- إصلاح كامل لمكتبة السكيلز بعد تقرير الـ lint: **141 skills — 0 issues, 0 collisions** (كانوا 74 issue + 37 collision).

### التغييرات
- **73 skill** اتحصلوا على `triggers:` في الـ frontmatter + **`always: true`** — بدون `always` كانت هتتحول لـ context-gated ويتعطّلوا في `matches_context` (اكتشفه `test_persona_reset` — qa-automation اختفى من الـ lords).
- **43 negative trigger** ("Do not use for X — use `other`") على الطرف الأقل تخصصًا في كل زوج متصادم.
- **`skill_lint.py`**: `_FAMILY_TOKENS` اتوسّعت بـ role-nouns (architect/engineer/…) + `_GENERIC_TOKENS` جديدة للـ single-word triggers العامة + قاعدة "shared trigger مش collision لو name-token أو generic" + استبعاد `README.md`/`index.json` من الـ glob.
- **`secret_scrub.py`**: prose-filter — قيمة pure-alpha <16 حرف بعد `key:` مش سر (`Authorization: Distinguish…` كان بيتحذف من ingest).
- **5 ملفات** فيها mojibake عربي pre-existing (`O?U?` bytes — unrecoverable من HEAD) اتستبدلت بـ triggers عربية سليمة.
- **`skills/index.json`** مولّد + متجاهل في gitignore زي `abstracts/`.

### فخ اكتُشف (batch 2b)
- `triggers:` في frontmatter aiZee = **gating condition** مش مجرد discovery hint — إضافته لسكيل unconditional بيعطّله لما `context` يخلو من task text. `always: true` يحافظ على الدلالات.
- `(?ms)` DOTALL في regex بيخلي `.*` ياكل أسطر — كلّفنا `personas:`/`tech_stack:` في 50 ملف؛ اتصلحوا بإرجاع الـ blocks verbatim من HEAD. التحقق بمقارنة keys قبل/بعد إلزامي بعد bulk edits.
- `git show HEAD:path` على Windows محتاج forward-slashes وإلا بيرجع فاضي بصمت — فحص إصلاحي كان no-op من غير ما أعرف.
- Coverage racing: `test --full` + `eval/harness` متزامنين بيكسروا `.coverage` shards — sequential بس.

## [2026-10-27] v6.5.0 — Security Review Pass (full code review)

### الملخص
- مراجعة كاملة بالـ SEC/DEV personas بعد الـ skill-repair: لقيت وصلّحت 4 مشاكل حقيقية في الموديولات الجديدة.

### الإصلاحات
- **`api_session.py` exfiltration guard** — absolute `path` لأي host كان هيبعت الـ auth bundle لدومين مهاجم؛ دلوقتي cross-host URL مرفوض + `_SameHostRedirect` handler بيمنع urllib من إعادة إرسال Authorization/Cookie في 302 لدومين تاني + `extra_headers` بقت داخلة في الـ kernel gate masked.
- **`gateway_proxy.py` DoS + gate-evasion** — `_read_body` بقى محدود بـ 10MB (`_MAX_BODY_BYTES` → 400) + prompt-gate window اتوسعت من 4k لـ 64k حرف (`_PROMPT_GATE_CHARS`) — injection مبقاش يقدر يتخبى ورا الحد القديم.
- **`sensitive.py`** — `mask_obj` بيحافظ على tuple type (كان بيحولها list).
- **Tests**: `_opener` real-build + cross-host deny + redirect block + OSError path + oversized-body raw-socket — 7417 pass + 100% cov.

### فخ اكتُشف (batch 2c)
- urllib `HTTPRedirectHandler` بيعيد إرسال **كل** الـ headers على redirect — بما فيها Authorization — لأي host. أي code بيلفّه لازم redirect-policy خاصة.
- Tests بتـpatch `urllib.request.urlopen` بتتكسر بصمت لما الـ code ينتقل لـ `build_opener().open()` — patch لازم يبقى على الـ seam (`_opener`) مش الـ stdlib.
